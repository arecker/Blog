title: notes for today
---

Made a Dutch baby in the morning.  The good news is that since it gets
so little flour, the civil war flour didn't really do any damage.
Rodney woke up with me and together we assembled it in the kitchen
before I set him up with Mr. Rogers on the couch.

Ate breakfast, and polished off a pot of coffee with Marissa.

Played outside.  Laughed that we pretty much looked like an
advertising for playing outside.  Marissa and I threw around the
football in the backyard.  Rodney and I played soccer.  Marissa raked
grass in the front of the house.  Rodney rode is bike in the sidewalk
while I kicked around my skateboard.  We played hockey in the
driveway.  Rodney celebrated a goal every time he shot the ball past
me into the street.

Took a break.  Poured some tequila and sat on the porch while Marissa
wrapped her extra extension cables.  "This is kind of the ultimate 'we
ran out of things to do' task isn't it?"  Laughed.  Rodney blew
bubbles in the front yard.

Went inside for quiet time.  Rodney went down for a nap, and Marissa
and I relaxed in the living room.  I hacked on my blog.  "Oh what did
you work on?" asked Marissa.  Stopped and thought for a moment.
"Nothing.  I just moved a bunch of stuff around.  It's amazing how
much you can work on something in code without actually changing what
it does."

Shut my laptop and got to making food.  Made some stamppot.  Thawed
frozen kale by dropping it in hot water, but forgot to run cold water
over it.  Got a little wet, which wasn't a big deal since it gets
boiled with the potatoes, but I cringed watching the green water run
into the sink.  Not because green water is gross, but I'm pretty sure
that means lost flavor and nutrients.  Somewhere, a distant Dutch
ancestor of mine rolled in their grave.  Made up for the soggy,
semi-extracted kale with a handful of cabbage to add some crunch, and
a spoonful of garlic in the pot.  Finally rested four chicken sausages
on top and closed the lid, cleaning the kitchen while it stewed.

Rodney played with his blocks at the table while I cooked and cleaned
up.  Beckoned me over whenever he made a new shape, showing off a long
ladder, a snake or a tower.  Trying to do a better job acknowledging
him, as I tend to err on the side 'anti-doting'.  "Dada look," showing
me a tall, sturdy tower.  Sat down to take it in.  "Nice dude."  "Just
a sec," ran into the kitchen.  Returned with a lighter.  "Now Rodney
light it on fire."  "No, Rodney you will not light it on fire.  Hey,
this is a big deal dude.  Say it, 'no fire'."  "No fire," he said,
smirking.  Told Marissa, "there's too much to think about with the
coronavirus.  Let's just block it out."

Called poppa to wish him a happy birthday.  The three of us sang, and
just as we got to the final syllable of _happy birthday to YOU_,
Marissa's crummy Android phone crashed and the screen went black.  We
stood there for a moment in silence, marveling at the timing.
"Wouldn't it be amazing if we just moved on with our night from here
and didn't clarify what happened.  'What?  We were done singing, so we
hung up?'"  Called again from my phone and laughed about it.

Put Rodney to bed.  Set-up zoom on Marissa's computer.  Last time we
talked to the doctor, she shared with us that visitation at the
hospital is pretty strict these days.  I'll definitely be the only
visitor allowed while Marissa gives birth, but there is a small chance
(if Madison gets as bad as, say, New York), I won't even be able to be
in the room.  Small piece of mind, performed a test call.  Chatted
with Marissa for a few minutes, me upstairs in my room and her at the
dining room table.  "This feels like when we used to Skype each other
every night when you were still in college.  'Hey baby girl!  How was
your day today?  I had a crummy day - I tried to dual boot Arch linux
on my Macbook, but stupid Apple, it's not working!  What an awful day,
I will try again tomorrow." I said pretending we were first dating.

Hacked on some code while Marissa painted.  Set up for a movie.
Watched a movie called _Serenity_.  About ten minutes in, blurted out
"yeah I've never seen this movie.  I realize now I was thinking about
_Aeon Flux_.  This is still an awesome movie."  Had a low budget, late
night sci-fi channel vibe to it.  Very ambitious, b rated actors,
awkward writing at times, but we were caught up in the sincerity of
the movie.  Looking forward to finishing that one.
