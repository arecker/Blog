Much more challenging finding things to write about.  Have never
really encountered writer's block before, but it was only a matter of
time.  At 315,000 words encounting, it was only a matter of time
before I would see the word reserves dry up.

Maybe I've gone too overboard with this whole bread thing, but there
are some parallels between writing and growing yeast.  Writing feels
like your cultivating a living organism.  You can ensure the
temperature and light are ideal, you can feed it, but you can't force
it to grow.  And sometimes when the words don't come easily, or there
is something else in life stressing you out, it's important to write
through it because the stress is good.  I've learned that yeast
produces its best flavors when it has to overcome something, like a
cold fridge.

Rodney and I began our day at the breakfast table.  I made him a fried
egg with cheese, placed on a flamed tortilla like a serving mat.  "Oh,
I love quesadillas," he said as I placed the plate in front of him,
dividing it in two for the both of us.

"Dude," I said.  "Did you know that when you were much smaller, you
used to not like eggs?"  Rodney nodded while chewing.  "It used to
drive me crazy - how many different things can you make for breakfast
without using eggs?  But you like eggies now, right?"

Rodney nodded, raising his tiny plastic fork, like he was toasting.

Polished off our plates.  "OK, dude, let's go play hockey."

Sun was warm, and even warmer when we reached the blacktop across the
street.  Worked up a sweat chasing the ball around.  "Dude, I gotta
get us some bigger hockey sticks," I griped.  "My back is killing me
bending over this stubby little thing."

Rodney suggested we walk back.  Hung out in the backyard and threw a
baseball around, then sank into a lawn chair with our coffee pot in
hand.  "You play, dude," I said.  "Daddy is gonna take a little
break."

Got a box of diapers in the mail.  I sat on the chair holding Miles,
not paying attention to what Rodney was doing.  He opened the box and
proceeded to take all 198 newborn size diapers out and throw them on
the floor.  Marissa came down the stairs and laughed.  "Dude, make a
diaper snow angel," I called out.

Inspired by the french cooking video I watched on washing vegetables,
was very thorough about preparing the red peppers with a pairing knife
over the sink.  Channeling my inner French cook, thoroughly rinsing
each slice.

Marissa beckoned me through the baby monitor to help in Rodney's room
with an accident.  Brought a few wedges of fresh bell pepper up the
stairs with me.  Rodney chomped on it as he climbed into the shower.

---

Got the swinging chair out of the shed and gave it a quick wipedown.
Marissa and I sat on the chair while mesquite smoke wafted from the
little holes in the top of the grill, drank a beer.  Rodney started to
climb up.

"Not now dude, we need a minute," I scolded.  Rodney slinked away
with a loud sigh.

"No sighing," snapped Marissa.  "I don't like that attitude."

We eyeballed him as he gingerly stepped off the porch.

"It's been a rough day," said Marissa with tears welling up in her
face.  "Sorry, it's been a weepy day too.  I just feel like I've been
peed and pooped on constantly all day."

Of course Miles was doing all the heavy lifting, but Rodney had a few
accidents as well, it felt like the bathtub and washing machine were
running all day.

Got up and went inside to finish the white rice, dumping in some
parsley with a pad of butter.  Took the lid of the grill to check the
chicken.  The skin had turned brown and crispy, left some sliced red
peppers along the side.

"Want to set the table?" I said.  Quartered up the chicken right on
the grill, finishing it over the fire.  The red peppers turned soft
and floppy, blisterning in the heat.  Marissa cut up the wings for
Rodney, and he cleaned his plate quickly.

"You're getting big dude," I laughed.  "I think next time we're going
to have to give you more than just the wings.  What the heck are we
gonna do when we have two hungry boys at the table, make a chicken for
each of them?"

Rodney went to bed after his wash finished, and Miles had his last
feeding of the night.  Hung out on the couch with Marissa.  "You're
doing great, buddy.  I'm proud of you - and do you know what that
means?"

Marissa looked at me confused.

"It's just a dumb little jingle I made up, and I say it to Rodney
every night.  It means I love you, I like you - and I think you're
cool."  I poked her nose.
