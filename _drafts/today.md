title: notes for today
---

Ticket duty this week.  Lots of smaller tasks that made the day go by
a lot faster.  Took a coffee break with Marissa after our morning
meeting.  Gotten into a routine of eating a stroopwaffel every day at
10 while hanging out with Marissa at the dining room table.  Fun to
see new routines emerging in my day.  Worked until lunch, then took a
walk around the neighborhood in the afternoon.

Left for Home Depot at five.  Marissa left me some idiot proof
instructions for finding the food slats she needed.  Navigated the
store, keeping six feet from everyone.  Frustrated that the rails
didn't line up exactly with the labels, and they were all kind of
mixed together.

"Can I help you find something?" asked a friendly employee.

"Nah, I'm good," I replied curtly.  Then I returned to staring at the
stalks of wood.  Fished four of them out and proceeded to cut in
half.  Struggled with the saw, found another that worked better.

"Doesn't it seem like they always set out one super dull saw to make
you look like an idiot?" I said.

"YES!" said Marissa.  "The first one I grab never works."

"Anyway, I did my best.  I think... I got all the right ones," I said
sifting the slats of food in my fingers.  My voice trailed off
noticing that instead of grabbing 8 of the same kind, I managed to
grab a few small ones, some big ones, and one piece of wood that
looked nothing like what Marissa needed.  "Ugh, I suck at this.
Sorry," I laughed.  No wonder why the cashier was so frustrated with
me.  I had handed her a complete hodgepodge of random wood off-cuts.
"I was wondering why it took her so long to ring everything up."

Retreated to the kitchen to make dinner.  Set aside the ground beef
for tacos, but taking stock of our fridge, we realized we would only
be able to put lettuce and cheese on them.  "Let's save tacos for when
we get that really _lekker_ guac from Jenny street," suggested
Marissa.

"Can I make pasta with meat sauce?" I asked hopefully.

Marissa smiled.  "I didn't take any Tums yet today."  I broke into
laughter.

"So that means after dinner, you can just eat all ten of them in a
row?" I said laughing.

I love making meat sauce.  We seem to always have the right spices on
hand.  And no matter what I decide to add on a whim, the end result
always makes me happy.  And after wandering around Home Depot like a
lost child, it felt good to be back in the kitchen in my natural
habitat.  While the beef was simmering in the blended tomatoes, I
added in soy sauce and worcestershire sauce.  _They both taste great
on a burger_ I rationalized.  _And with ground beef and tomatoes
sitting on a pile of carbs, we basically have a burger so far_.

Marissa sat in the kitchen with me.  In between stirring the sauce, we
both watched Rodney play outside.  He ran up to the door to get our
attention.

"MOMMA," he said out of breath.  "I FOUND A WORM."  Rodney held his
hand forward, revealing a tiny earthworm curled up in his hand.

"Wow, dude, cool!" said Marissa, trying to mask her disgust.

"Nice job dude," I said to Rod without missing a beat.  "Do you want
me to put it in the pasta sauce?  We could always use the extra
protein."  I knelt to meet him, doing my best not to break character.

"Um... no _danks_," said Rodney, brushing me aside.

Started a new Google doc for Miles stuff.  "Look," I said to Marissa.
"It's got a little table of contents with hyperlinks to the sections.
And there, I added one for work.  It's got just the basic facts,
contacts, and a to-do list for before and after Miles is born."

Marissa nodded in approval.

Rest of the evening was sucked up by our dining room computer.
Finishing up work, hit 'power' instead of 'reboot'.  Groaned loudly,
knowing that it would take several minutes to find the magic
combination of unplugging the power cable, hitting the power button,
and removing the HDMI chord that tricks our Intel NUC into booting
properly.  After ten minutes of fiddling, the screen came to life,
only the resolution was dropped to 1024x768.

"Oh yay!  You fixed it," said Marissa, trying to inject some
positivity into my evening.  "This looks normal to you?" I scoffed.
"Look, everything on the screen is enormous.  I've had it with this
computer, it's such a battle getting it to do the most normal things.
And it couldn't have an easier job!"

I paused, letting my anger subside.  And after letting out a deep
sigh, I rose from the computer.  "I'll have to break out the VGA cable
or something, maybe re roll this computer sometime this week.  I'm
sick of this bullshit - I'm never getting another NUC for as long as I
live."

Moved into the kitchen and threw together a bread dough while Marissa
prepared a snack.  Grabbed a PBR out of the fridge, took a sip, and
made a face.

"Why are you drinking PBR?!" exclaimed Marissa.

"I don't know, I feel bad wasting it and I wanted to just get rid of
it," I replied.

"Just dump it out!" said Marissa.

"I feel bad wasting anything!  These are practically _war times_ you
know."  Stood by the sink and let the PBR guzzle into the sink drain.
Even in tough times, life's too short not to drink beer you like.
