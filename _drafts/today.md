Headed to the grocery store in a mask and gloves.  Quickly snagged
some Easter candy off the shelf.

"You did good with the candy, except these are... _spicy_ Jelly
beans."

"Oh no kidding, let me try one.  Oh gross, what is this, dill?"
Rodney made a face and brushed his tongue with his fingers, reaching
for milk.

Needed to keep Rodney busy while Marissa painted.  Together we stuck
the ham in the oven, make the glaze, and also baked a batch of
cookies.  This was the first batch of sugar cookies I've made with
Rodney, and I have to say I see the appeal.  The process of taking out
each lump of dough and arranging it on the pan was both incredibly
safe and very time consuming - the ideal situation for entertaining a
child when you just need to run the clock out.  "Almost done dude," I
said.  "Make sure they're perfectly spaced out."  I pretended to
rearrange the cookies while he finished taking them out of the tray.

Set the cookies in the oven underneath the ham.  Sat on the floor with
Rodney after clicking the oven light on.  We both peered eagerly
through the dim oven window.  Oven already smelled pretty strong of
clove and anise.  "Dude, do you think are cookies are going to taste
like ham?"

Set the cookies aside to cool, and while the ham baked, I worked a bit
on the computer.  Took my attention off of Rodney, but he seemed
content.  Marissa came down the stairs and stood frozen in the dining
room.

"What happened here?" she said.  I whipped my head around and gasped,
seeing most of the dirt from the potted plant by our window thrown
onto the floor.

"Oops.  Sorry, I didn't notice him do this."

"Rod?" asked Marissa.  "What were you doing to the plant?"

Rodney wandered in the dining room to defend himself.  "_Vlagabla
dlagaba_ looking for SPIDERS," he said, giving his toy flashlight a
wave.

"I was wondering why hands and feet were so dirty.  I thought it had
just been a long time since we gave him a bath."

Marissa got him cleaned up and sent him upstairs for quiet time,
taking a nap on the couch herself.  I hung out with the ham.  Did you
know they're already cooked?  The oven just warms them up.  Ham isn't
complicated - it's just time consuming.  I had to take it out every
twenty minutes and brush it with glaze.

"Knew I could ask you to get me something every twenty minutes,"
Marissa laughed.

Easter dinner prep crescendoed into setting the table.  I removed the
tinfoil, warmed up the leftover glaze, and put some quiet Bocelli on.
"Where are you guys?" I shouted up from an empty dining room.

"Sorry," said Marissa walking in.  "We had a really bad poop to deal
with.  And also Rodney _ripped_ his Bible."

"There was _something up_ with it," protested Rodney.

Ate dinner, moved to the dining room for an easter egg hunt.  Rodney
ran around the living room with delight looking for plastic eggs
filled with candy.  Afterwards, we set up an easter egg hunt for the
dogs, using the same eggs with dog treats.  Rodney seemed to get even
more excited about their version.

Ate some candy, took pictures wearing bunny ears, and we even
microwaved a peep - which don't explode in the microwave, at least not
right away.  They just get big and puffy.

Last night Marissa worked on a cardboard racetrack for Rodney.  Came
into the dining room and she was sawing, taping cardboard together.

"So let me guess, you critically underestimated how much time this
would take?"

"Oh definitely.  It's safe to say this is the only thing I'm
accomplishing tonight."

"He's going to love it.  This is really cool."
