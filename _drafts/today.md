Heated up leftover pasta with Rodney.  After scarfing down my bowl,
started to feel sleepy.  Marissa joined us in the dining room.
Glanced at the clock and saw it was barely 12:30.  My eyes lit up with
an idea.  "If I dozed off on the couch, could you make sure I'm up by
1?" I asked.  Marissa nodded, "Of course!  Sounds _lekker_."  Slinked
into the living room and slithered under a blanket.  In an out for a
few minutes, then woke up to Rodney running into the living room at 1.
The perfect nap.

The plan was to have sandwiches for dinner, but taking the bread dough
out, I knew that plan was in trouble.  The new wheat flour didn't work
so well, it had barely risen.  Left it out to proof just in case, but
it wasn't looking very appetizing.  Looked like a dried out piece of
bark.

Took it out of the oven.  Smelled kind of weird, like someone had just
lit some wheat on fire.  Cut into it.  Edible, but just bad enough to
warrant ordering a pizza.  Gave Marissa the signal and she got Glass
Nickel on the phone.

Didn't know what to do with myself, so joined Rodney outside and lit a
cigar, even though it was pretty cold out.  Rodney was just as happy
playing in his sandbox and running around.  Marissa joined us too, and
was inspired to take a some agility jumps out of the shed and set them
up.  Fun seeing Ziggy and Ollie do some agility, it's been too long
for them.

Pizza arrived.  Headed inside and washed up.  Enjoyed pizza on the
couch while watching _X-men: Evolution_.  "This show is really good,"
said Marissa.

"Yeah, isn't it?  It holds up pretty well, I used to watch this show
in high school."

Rodney was wholly in his element, lounging on the couch holding a
long, thin slice of cheese pizza.

"He looks like a college kid right now."

Tuesday evening Zoom with the Recker family.  Rodney was very excited,
then went off to play by himself.  Found a comic book and climbed into
Ziggy's crate, contently flipping through the pages.  Nudged Marissa
to spy on him and take it in.

Knocked out my exercise and Dutch lesson for the evening.  Started
straightening up the kitchen.  Put on a Dutch podcast.  Marissa hung
around near the kitchen to poke fun at the podcast.  "They have lots
of songs, and some of them are pretty catchy," I said.  "In the last
episode I listened to, they kept singing
_ROOOOOTTERDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM_," belted it out operatically.

"Are you picking up on words?"

"Actually yeah, but I don't try to.  It's a fun change of pace from
Duolingo.  I can shut off my brain and just focus on the sounds.
Sometimes when she says a word or phrase I like, I imitate it.  Like,
I really like how she opens each episode with _En deze
alflevering..._, meaning _In this episode..._.  And of course, there's
also..." paused for a moment then whipped my head back.
"ROOOOTERRRDAAAAAAAAAAAM!"

"I like watching him read comic books."  "Mmm."  "You know Heath was
telling me they still make Highlights.  We should get him a magazine,"
I said while scooping up a ripped page from my otherwise pristine copy
of _Spider-Man: Civil War_.  "Aaand that would also give him something
to rip up and color that's not my comic book," I said a little peeved.
