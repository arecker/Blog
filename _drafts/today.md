title: notes for today

Felt good to wake up early and get a jump on things.  By the time
Rodney was up, I had already finished writing and cleaning the
kitchen.  Invited him downstairs and set him up on the couch so I
could start making hash.  Bumping the new Megan Thee Stallion mixtape,
which is great cooking music.

Typical hash.  Bacon, then tossed the potatos in bacon grease.  Soaked
it up, and let them get crispy.  Rod helped me throw in the butter,
showed him a trick where you can use the side of the pan to scrape the
butter off.  "Oh I get it."

Got the bins filled with close out of the basement.  Started going
through all of them, sorting, folding, putting into bins.  "Want to
start folding things and putting them back in?"  Twenty minutes into
things, stood up and stretched my legs.  "So I'm starting to get
discouraged.  How long do you think this will take?"  We'll be done by
the time we finish the movie.  Oh my gosh - I'm a slow folder, aren't
I?  You're a very good folder.  Just too particular.  I'm kind of
having fun looking through old clothes, you can just hang.  Thanks, I
was in my own personal hell but afraid to admit it.

Since we had an early brunch, made Rodney a snack.  A hardboiled egg
and some reheated fries.  Put Rodney down for a nap.  I moved all the
boxes downstairs, and we sat at the table.  Marissa had a snack, and I
opened up a beer.  Had a nice chat sitting at the table.  "Isn't it
kind of funny right now that the whole world is just at home
chilling?"

Marissa and I dozed off on the couch watching TV.  Woke up to Rodney
crying upstairs, so I got him out of bed.  He was feeling very cuddly,
climbed into my lap and together we watched some Mr. Rodgers.  Going
to try to play Mr. Rodgers more often for him.  Calming presence.  But
soon he asked to switch back to ninja turtles, so I obliged him.

Had leftovers for dinner.  Marissa laid claim to the leftover hash,
and Rodney and I ate some leftover pizza.  Also heated up a big bowl
of fries.

We put Rodney to bed.  "Want to get started on the bathroom closet?"
"Well I was going to put his laundry away.  But then again, I am a
slow folder as I just discovered." 

Before bed, read a book.  Rodney grabbed a tiny book with an orca
whale on the front that was deceptively sad and complicated.  "You
sure you want to read this one?  It's pretty small - _oh I get it_.
It's like an actual novel.  About an orca pup that almost gets
captured by fisherman then beached on a shore.  Dog eared the page and
made an empty promise to finish reading it the next day.

Good kids books are hard to find.  You want a book that's fun and
engaging without getting them too riled up.  You also want few words
on the page, but not so few that you spend more time turning the pages
than you do reading.  That makes for dead air, and kids get bored.

Marissa and I cleaned out the bathroom closet.  She had already taken
care of two of the shelves, so we went through the medicine together.
"Some of this medicine expires before... we were even married.  How
did that even happen?"  Moved all the medicine to a single bin, and I
started to get pedantic.  "Well it bothers me that something we use
every day is in the same bin with something that we never use - like
these bottles of peroxide."  Blank stare from Marissa.

"_Oh shit, I cut my finger.  Oh man where is the bandaid I'm bleeding
all over the place.  Is it here?  Nope, just an ear removal kit, oh
God there's blood everywhere, still looking for the bandaids."
Flinging things out of the bin, belaboring my point.

"What do you suggest?"

"I like keeping things we need fast in their own bin.  Thermometer.
Bandaids.  Ibuprofen.  That way we have hot storage and cold storage."

Met in our room to pick tasks for the week.  Marissa kicked ass on
Miles' room, so feeling pretty good about that.  Going to pick up a
few miscellaneous tasks for the week to keep the energy up.

Looking forward to a new work week.  Going to try to practice better
time management and not work on one thing for too long.
