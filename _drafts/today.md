title: notes for today

At work, my team is tasked with exporting every set of project
environment variables onto the new system we're using.  One of those
crummy tasks that sits right on the fence of justifiable automation.
Sure, we could automate it.  It might take about three days to write a
script, test it, send it around for approval.  But then again, we
might be done in two days if we just work at it together - it's a very
simple workflow.  As a result, we're left with this funny amount of
manual effort that sort of felt like data entry.  After finishing a
set, I'd reward myself with a quick scroll down reddit or some poking
at a side project.

Made some lunch for Marissa and Rodney.  A few turkey and cheese
quesadillas.  Between leftovers and last week's big grocery haul,
blessed with lots of choices for lunch.  I like making quesadillas,
it's a lunch sized activity, and it's nice to pull my brain out of
work and focus on something else.

Put Rodney down for a nap.  Since I was just working on environment
variables, I agreed to check on Rodney, as it was time for a poop.  I
set a timer on my phone to remind me to check him every fifteen
minutes.  But I think the frequency made him anxious.  Rodney spent
most of the time in the hallway between our rooms talking to me.
After two hours of trying, heard some tears coming out of his room.
He had had an accident.

"Are you frustrated?" asked Marissa.

"Yeah, it's a little demoralizing having an accident after staying on
top of it for his entire nap time.  I'm frustrated with myself - I
feel like I was checking on him too often and it made him nervous."

"I didn't get that sense," she replied.  I shrugged.

"I was trying to check him often enough to catch it, but not so often
that he couldn't relax and enjoy himself.  I'm frustrated with my own
estimation.  He definitely wasn't relaxed, I think he felt pressure."

"Well, as awful as it sounds, I think even just the fact that he was
upset about it is progress.  Remember, only a week ago we were arguing
with him about where poop was supposed to go."

That's a good point.  I don't like seeing him upset, but he wouldn't
be upset if he weren't working through the problem.

Can we take a minute to celebrate pooping?  Maybe not so much the act,
but the ritual.  Pooping is guaranteed alone time.  Pooping is time to
slow down and think.  What other time are we given to sit in one
place until we're comfortable?

Sad for Rodney that pooping still stresses him out.  It's such a
fundamental part of our wellbeing, breaks my heart.

Dumped the bread onto a pan after doing a pretty decent job shaping it
into a baguette.  Covered in oil and plastic and set it aside, but the
soft, mushy dough flattened out.  "No worries," I thought.  "I can cut
the polish sausages in half.

Seared the sausages, then dumped in the onions.  Fragrant smells
filled the house.  Removed the bread from the oven, which was also
looking just great.  Took it all over to the cutting board to
assemble.  Squirted some mustard onto the open slices of bread and
started to spread it around with a spoon.

_This is a lot of mustard_, I thought.  Perhaps being so close to
finishing the bottle caused me to unintentionally use the rest.  Or
maybe the fresh loaf of bread deceptively soaked up the extra, which
coaxed me into adding more.

Served the sandwiches, and I was first to take a bite.  It was way too
much mustard, but I hid my reaction until Marissa went in for a bite.
She imperceptively winced.  I leaned in.  "Is is enough mustard for
you?" I asked with wide eyes.  Marissa broke out in a laugh, then a
cough.  "Ah, you got the mustard coughs.  That's common with this
sandwich, just power through it."  She laughed harder, and tears
rolled off her eyes.

"Calm down, momma," said Rodney.
