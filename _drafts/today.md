title: notes for today

Is it just me, or does life kind of seem busy again?  There was a long
stretch of time when the quarantine started where it felt like I had
all this free time staying at home.  Starting to get worried that once
we get a taste of actual life, we're going to be constantly exhausted.

Played catch with Rodney in the backyard.  Marissa laughed, telling me
that she was trying to play baseball with him, and he had a hard time
hiding his disappointment with how she was throwing.  Tells me he said
"no, try to hit the bat, momma."  So played some catch with him in the
yard.  Rodney's hands are getting pretty good.  Lobbed the football at
him, fully expecting it to just bounce right off his face and hit the
ground, and that only happened a few times.  Surprised us with a few
good catches.  He looked proud.

Another shopping trip.  Marissa ordered new face masks from an
Instagram friend, and it really made a difference.  Happy to finally
throw out the construction mask.  That thing was tough to breathe in,
and dried out my mouth so bad I'd return from the grocery store with a
near bloody nose.

Returned with groceries.  A smaller trip and got through it much more
quickly.  Also included a six pack of Fantasy Factory, which we're
reserving for Marissa when she is done being pregnant.  I think that
made Marissa pretty excited.

Made a nice filling dinner.  Marissa watched Rodney in the morning, so
I did my best to play interference with him in the afternoon while she
napped.  Rodney and I prepped dinner.  Actually put him to work, he
used _glubbed_ hands to flip the pork chops over while I seasoned
them.  And he helped me cut the asparagus too.

Practiced cutting them with a real knife, using good technique.  We
learned how to curl our fingers back and handle a knife safely.  "Yeah
I did it!" he said raising his hands in the air, still holding the
knife.  Quickly snatched it out of his hand.  "You gotta keep the
knife on the board dude."  Demoted back to a butter knife.

Marissa gave me a hair cut.  Halfway through cutting and shaving, my
face was looking really strange and I winced in the mirror.

"What's wrong?"

"I'm looking really gnarly right now."

"Well I'm not finished yet."

"Oh I know.  And you'll do a good job.  It's just kind of crazy to
think that if I wanted, I could be _this_ ugly all the time."
Laughed.

Marissa cut her own hair too.  "I was starting to just resent it.  My
hair gets so long that the curls get sad because of all the weight."

Some hacking on reckerbot.  Got a basic grocery list working.  The aim
is to replace the app we're using by next week, since it's going away.
Still some bugs, but staying diligent and tenacious about fixing them.
I'd like to make something really useful for us.
