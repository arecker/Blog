title: notes for today
---

Shopping at Hy-Vee.  Grumpy, but the nice weather got me into it.
Beautiful spring air, even when inhaling through my mask.

Realized that I wasn't getting anything that I was really looking
forward to eating.  So treated myself to some pancietta, goat cheese,
and threw in an extra steak.  Perhaps there's real wisdom in the
overused expression _treat yourself_.

Watched church on the couch.  Ziggy crawled into my lap, and did her
usual think where she just turns into an atom bomb of warmth and
coziness, was fighting the urge to sleep during church.

Another day, another bread fail.  Pulled two bleach white, swollen,
doughy masses out of the oven.  Rolled the filling into a bouncy ball
and threw it around the kitchen with Rodney.

"Tired of sticking it in the fridge.  I think it doesn't work.  The
air must be drier here, I don't think you can be as tough on the
yeast."

Screw it.  I'm going back to my old recipe and method.  Just gonna
dump it into a bowl and leave it on the counter under foil.  Also
dumped in some of my beer.

Ramping up to having a baby.  Yesterday we packed Rodney's go-bag, and
things are starting to get real.  Have tried to explain to him a few
times what's going on, and he doesn't seem to phased by it.

Rodney helped pack the go-bag of course.  Followed me downstairs into
the basement to get the duffel bag.  "Dada - light off."  Clicked the
basement light off and fumbled with our flashlight, finally finding
the button.  I nodded and we ventured further into the now much darker
basement.

Going to be fascinating watching Rodney deal with recursing through
his favorite TV shows.  Will he learn to share the TV?  Reminisced
with Marissa about the phases we went through.

"The hardest time was probably when he just wanted to watch _Sing_ non
stop."

"Yeah that was a lot of Matthew McConaughey.  Too much."

"The story bots phase.  That was good, I don't mind the music."

"Ugh.  Paw Patrol.  It's a lot of Paw Patrol, I think even Rodney is
going to get sick of it."
