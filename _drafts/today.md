title: notes for today

Leaning into the no oven lifestyle, which I have to admit, I was kind
of panicking at first, but realized it's not so bad.  Especially in
the summer when there's a great excuse to break out the grill every
night.  So wanted to stock up on charcoal.

Home Depot was my first stop.  They're having people queue up outside
the store and using a counter to let people in.  Actually had to wait
outside for ten minutes or so before heading in.  Grabbed four bags of
charcoal, two big bags of wood chunks, and some tinfoil.

Hy-Vee next.  Hy-Vee was pretty nice, not too many people were out
shopping.  And as we're transitioning to a new grocery list system, I
had already ordered and printed it out and was just checking things
off with a pen - old school.  Rounded the trip off with a final beer
haul for when Marissa is no longer pregnant.  Now fully stocked with
Fantasy Factory and Pseudo Sue.

Marissa helped put the groceries away, using the cleaning momentum to
tidy up our fridge.

Grilled up our dinner outside.  Filled the grill with enough charcoal
to last into the evening, and set some russet potatoes along the
outside of the grate.  Lately I appreciate how practical potatoes are,
and how it's practically impossible to overcook them.  What a
functional food.  Love just setting them next to whatever heat source,
feels so primal.

Seared two very juicy ribeye steaks and set them aside.  Blistered
some sliced red peppers next.

After dinner, walked around the corner to take sticks from my
neighbors yard.  Broke them down and threw them in, using them to
restoke the coal embers into a bonfire.  I leaned my head in to call
Rodney out.  "Of course now he's just inside playing with his toys,"
laughed Marissa.

Rodney saw the fire and got pretty excited, pulling up a chair next to
me.  Followed by Marissa, and Ziggy leapt up into her lap.

"Fire is dangerous," said Momma sternly.

"But it's also interesting."  Marissa glared.  "Interesting, as long
as your are careful with it."

"Don't go _Blippi_ on me, you're going rogue," she said.  I guess that
requires some explanation.

Feeling the sunset and warm fire was conducive to reflection, we tried
to coax some reflections out of Rodney.  "How are you feeling about
getting a new brother?"  But he just whipped his head around and with
his ear to Marissa's stomach started barking "BABY MILES?  WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU OUT."

Putting Rodney to bed, had another shot with trying to get Rodney to
think about what was going on.  Arrived at question time.  After the
easy ones, like 'what did you eat?' and 'what did you play with?',
asked a question about Miles.  "What is he going to look like?  What
color will his eyes be?"

Looked very serious, and started to describe what he was picturing.
"His eyes are... yellow.  And they glow read.  And they're yellow, but
they SHOOT red,"

"You're describing Cyclops from X-men, aren't you?"  Got up from bed,
as Rodney was still rambling about how Miles would be able to energy
blasts from his eyes.  "You're ridiculous, dude."
