title: notes for today

While winding up for the work day, could hear Rodney losing his mind
over the racetrack Marissa set up for him.  The night before, she
labored, taping cardboard together and sawing particle board tubes in
half.  "Let me guess," I said.  "You massively underestimated how long
this would take?"

"Oh definitely," said Marissa without skipping a beat.  "This is the
only thing I'm accomplishing tonight."

The finish track went across the fireplace mantle, across the living
room, underneath the train table, and along the empty fish tank.
"He's going to lose his mind when he sees this."

After finishing my morning meeting, I peeked my head downstairs to
bask in Rodney's enthusiasm.  Marissa sat drinking coffee on the couch
while Rodney scurried about with his cars.  He was so preoccupied that
he didn't notice me.

"Did he like it?" I asked.

"Yeah, he went crazy.  But look, it's actually nice outside.  I
thought it was supposed to rain.  I can't believe I wasted one of my
good parenting idea," she replied.

Rolled out of bed at 6:30 and got Rodney out of his room.  Together we
both sleepily put my laundry away then wandered downstairs, trying not
to wake up Marissa.  I decided to start on dinner.

"Dude, let's just make French toast," I said, remembering we still had
a stale French loaf stashed in the kitchen.  I sliced the bread while
Rodney got the step ladder out of the corner.  We cracked some eggs,
poured a bowl of milk, and together dipped each piece of bread and
dropped it in a large pan.  As per usual, the activity only held
Rodney's attention for so long.  In due time, he was fishing things of
interest off the kitchen counter with a giant pair of grill tongs he
found - quite the distraction, especially while we had two pans
cooking at the same time.

One by one, I dropped each finished piece in a bowl, dumping in
cinnamon sugar.  Rodney helped himself to the dredge, using his finger
to wipe extra sugar from the sides.  He tried to do the same with the
butter on the counter, but I intervened.  "No butter, dude," I said,
snaking my arm around him to slide it out of reach.

We plated up the french toast, and as Rodney and I were adding sliced
bananas and leftover Easter ham, suddenly the meal began to take form.
"I don't know about you dude," I said, "but this meal is actually
starting to look pretty thoughtful.  It looks like we actually planned
this out!"  Rodney snapped the grill tongs together in approval.

Headed outside as a family for a quick chore.  Marissa found on
Madison's website a way to package cardboard.  "Tied up in a square,
no wider than 3 feet by 3 feet and no higher than 6 inches.  Stack
next to the can," she read.  Together, we tackled the growing pile of
cardboard in our shed.  Marissa packed it into squares and I tied it
with butcher's twine.  And Rodney wandered around, finding sticks and
branches and wedging them inside the cardboard, whimsically declaring
"THESE ARE FOR _FRIENDS_".  It was a productive way to channel our
bruch-dinner sugar rush.

Skyped the Wilke's on the couch.  They're Internet is always a little
spotty where their residence is in beautiful rural New Hampshire, but
appreciated how they were all still gathered around the phone,
patiently waiting to get a word in.  Marissa asked "What has been
making you happy?"

Luke said "playing playstation online with the boys."  I laughed,
nodding in agreement.  "It's the golden age of video games, isn't it?"

Emma and Nicole both said food.  With everyone, home, they've been
spending more time in the kitchen.  "We made Spanish rice with
Shrimp," she said proudly.

Little Claire has been reading books.  She listed off three books
she's finished since the lockdown began.

Chris said it made him happy spending time with his family.  And it
sounds like the hospital he works at figured out a new shift schedule
that minimizes everyone's exposure and gives him more time at home.
