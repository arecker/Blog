title: notes for today
---

Marissa came back from the hospital with some good news.  "They're
going to let us induce, and we can pick any day after May 4."  Made
sense to us why the hospital would want to induce, but just relieved
to hear them say it.  And kind of floored at how soon that's coming.
"I suddenly realized I won't be working for very much longer.  That's
only two whole weeks."

Had a pending Target online order to pick up.  Marissa sat down at the
computer.  "I'm going to see if I can add butter, we're running low."
Clicked around their website.  "Nope.  No butter.  Just a lot of weird
brands of peanut butter.  Why is almost nothing available on their
website?"

"I think Target is one of those places that benefits from people
buying more than they planned on.  I bet they only put stuff on their
website if nobody is buying it in the store.  That's gotta be why
there's almost no choices."  Smiled, satisfied with my own theory.

"Ohhhhh that makes sense.  Man Target sucks."

Finally got to work on the chicken with Rodney.  It thawed overnight,
and together at the cutting board we separated the thighs, breasts,
and wings and threw the rest in the pot for stock.

"See these?  These are the wings."  I held my arms outstretched to
mimic the bird on the cutting board, and Rodney did likewise.

Had a few bumps in the impromptu homeschool lesson.  Was showing
Rodney the chicken's heart, and it rolled onto the floor where a
hungry Ziggy was waiting to gobble it up, as if I had just dropped a
regular piece of gristle.  "That was a raw chicken heart, you
monster," I said.  She stared at me blankly, licking her lips.  "She's
a wild animal dude, I can't believe she ate that."

Rodney got off his ladder to help, touching a few surfaces with his
gloved hand on the way down.  I mentally tagged each place so I could
clean it with Windex after our activity.  Held him up by the armpits
to the sink to wash up.

Marissa got Rodney in his PJs while I cleaned up from dinner.  Put the
dogs away and jumped in the car, first driving to Target.  An employee
in a mask dropped off our bag and we headed to the airport.  Rodney
craned his head out the window in anticipation.  "Keep your eyes
peeled, the lights are coming," we said.

"There they are," said Rodney, pointing out the window.  He saw one of
MATC's emergency phones casting a blue light.  We laughed.  "Well
that's a cool light, but don't worry dude you'll know it when you see
it."

Got to the airport.  Greeted by a row of Christmas lights wrapped
around trees, propped up by stands.  Big sign that said _FLY LOCAL_.
Cracked our windows even though it was drizzling with cold rain so we
could get a better view.  Recognized a lot of these lights from what
they set up at the Zoo for Christmas.

"They did a nice job with this," I said.  "And I like thinking about
the person that got to work on this, that was probably a fun
undertaking during the quarantine."

Saw an Alien saucer, a giant globe, a big orange basketball, and there
was also a Packers helmet.  We _boo'ed_ just loud enough to get our
point across.

As we were leaving, so a big stretch of cars filing into the airport.
"Look at how many people are going around," said Marissa.

"People are so bored right now.  Look at how popular this is!  And
it's just Christmas lights."

Not to say that I didn't appreciate the effort.  It was a cool little
activity, and it lifted our spirits.

Finally broke into my giant bag of yeast.  Read up on how to store it
online, and my heart sang when I read _a ziploc bag_.  "Well I can
definitely handle that."  I store just about everything in gallon
sized ziploc bags.

Sheer coincidence that the podcast I was listening to was joking about
yeast shortages.  "If you have a five pound bag of yeast right now,
you're basically Omar [from _The Wire_].  You _run_ these streets."

Spent the rest of the evening making stock and cleaning out our
fridge.  The windows fogged from the steam, so we spent the rest of
the evening exchanging Rodney's catch phrase that he coined.  The last
time we made stock, he saw the steamy windows and said "Momma,
somethin' goin' on here.  There's somethin' goin' on over 'der."
We're raising a good midwestern boy - he's already dropping all the
right letters.
