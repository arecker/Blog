title: notes for today

Sat around the table and ate some leftovers for lunch.  Told Marissa I
found an old blog entry she wrote for my site called "Five Ways My
Corgi Has Made Me a Better Person".  Spontaneously started reading it
aloud at the table.

"Want we to keep going?"

"Yeah, I'm actually enjoying this.  I'm not cringing as badly as I
thought I would."

"You put a lot of work into this, it sounds like something you would
write for school."

"I was smarter back than."

Spent the afternoon experimenting with a new language.  Had to compile
it from source to get the tool I was looking for.  Reems of garbled
compilation messages streamed across my screen while tiny macbook
cried.  "You can probably turn our heat off, I'll just heat the house
with my computer while I install _dhall_."

Rodney and I made gnocchi.  Microwaved some sweet potatoes, and he was
very helpful with stabbing them with a butter knife.  While I scooped
the flesh into a bowl, I set Rodney up with the stock pot filled with
water.  Put him to work adding salt.  Even though it required probably
a whole cup of salt, I instructed him to do it in small handfuls so it
would take a lot longer.

He finally got interested again when I brought out the eggs.  Helped
him crack an egg into a bowl.  Rodney dipped his finger into the bowl
and tasted it.  "Do you like raw eggs?"  Nodded.  "Nice one Rocky."

Mixed in some flower to make a dough, cut him off a piece.  Started
focusing on rolling out the dough and cutting it into pillows.  Looked
over at Rodney after a few minutes of work and he had picked up on it,
rolling it into a snake.  Actually contributed to the pile of gnocchi
we were making and that was pretty cool.

See why the recipe emphasized so much time mashing up the sweet
potatoes.  We went a little cheap on time, and as a result there were
some chunks in our little doughy pillows.  We started yelling "THAT'S
A CHUNKY" in the kitchen.

"Dude, making gnocchi with you was the highlight of my day," I told
him later.

Had a video chat with Ben and Beth.  Caught up on kids, work, moving.
"So what bread are you making."  "Ah so you're one of these bread
weirdos."  Got to talking about starter.  Explained that all you need
is some unbleached flour and king arthur's is the best.  His comment
sat in the back of my mind, and afterwards I went down to start on
chores.  Suddenly realized that the _civil war_ flour I had been
ragging on when I couldn't find white flour was the exact type.
Looked it up and sure enough, this stuff is the preferred method of
making sourdough starter.  Set aside the experiment in some
tupperware.  Thanks for the bread tip, Ben.

Snapped about using one of the fantasy factories for beer.  "That's
enough to get you trashed twice, especially since you'll be kind of a
light weight."  Immediately apologized.  Think that speaks to what
she's going through.

Decided to move ahead with our movie pick.  Currently in Spider-Man
Far From Home.  We like to play around with movie names, especially
when we're _not_ enjoying the movie are only obligated to finish it by
the Recker family rules of movie selection.

"Would you like to resume _Spider-man: Far From Over_?"

Lashed out at Far From Home.  "I'm so sick of these Marvel movies.
Why can't we have a movie that's just about Spider-Man, this is
basically an ironman movie."

"Yeah I like him as Spider-Man, it's a shame.  He's good."

"No.  He's not.  He sucks."

Marissa looked at me, expectant of a justification.  But I thought it
would be even funnier to leave my reasoning at that.  "Look at him.
He sucks.  And Jake Gylenhaal sucks too."

"_The Last Kiss_?  More like _The Last Zach Braff Movie we will be
watching in a while_"

Mark Wallberg in Disney's _Invincible_?  We call it _Unwatchable_.

The Terminal: The Terminally Awful Ending.

_We Bought a Zoo_ was _Matt Damon Buys a Zoo_.

Sometimes we get lazy with them.  While slogging through the X-Men
movies, we'd just make up our own sequel names like "X-Men: More
X-Men" and "X-Men 3: Another X-Men Movie".
