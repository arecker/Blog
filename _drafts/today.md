title: notes for today
---

"My post was pretty gloomy today, don't expect to feel uplifted."

Laughed.  "Well we had a bad day yesterday."

"Which was weird, because Friday was the best day ever.  We had the
best day ever, immediately followed by the worst day ever."

Sunday was the average of the two.  Went to Hy-Vee to pick up
supplies.  Getting chilly out, so decided to make soup.  Although this
trip was mostly beer.  It's wonderful to get a drinking buddy back.
It has been liberating to open the throttle up on the beer runs and
get more variety.

Also mixed in some more pickled items, grabbing some pickled asparagus
and red peppers.  Still learning how to shop for shelf life, and I
think for some stuff canned is not always the answer.  Have been
dissapointed with canned vegetables, so giving pickling a try.

After all, that's why pickling was invented, right?  So things could
keep on the shelf.

Made soup with a loaf of sourdough beer bread.  Melted cheese on top.
"This tastes so good right now I could cry."  Finished up dinner
before conducting a round of mother's day calls.

Responded to an interesting email that has been sitting in my inbox.
A complete stranger stumbled upon an old blog post I wrote about
Seinfeld outlining a theory around how all the characters change.  A
thoughtful email, felt bad because I saw it in my inbox on the way to
the delivery room and finally had time to sit down and do it justice.

Discussing how sitcom characters change, and what that can do for a
show as special as Seinfeld.  Kind of neat thinking about this stuff
again.

I think for sitcoms, it's a remarkable task to make it _bearable_
after the twelfth or thirteen pass.  Submit the Office as evidence.
But it's really something when a show can still make you think, and
certain scenes and moments just nag at your brain until you can work
them into your understanding of the show.

Lately I've been thinking about moments in the Seinfeld history that
criticize itself.  The most obvious is the story arch where Jerry and
George pitch the show _Jerry_, which is obviously a meta story line
for pitching Seinfeld.

But then there's episodes like the bizarro world.  Elaine breaks up
with her boyfriend, suggesting they be friends instead, and he
surprisingly takes her up on it.  Elaine meets his friend group, and
they have their own versions of Kramer, George, and Newman, and
they're all kind to each other, they read books, they donate to
charity.  I feel like that was a comment on the show, as if to say
"look at how strange nice people appear in this universe we've made!"

The finale is another example of this.  And the way they ended
Seinfeld was very anti-sitcom.  Fans have come to expect that in a
finale, a tribute is owed to them for sticking with the show for so
long.  But the Seinfeld finale was self-critical.  "See these
characters you've come to know, love, and identify with?  They're
monstrous people - we tricked you."  I think that's why people hated
the ending so much.  Maybe they should've just went out on the clip
show instead.

Snacks will be provided at this meeting.  A Belgian beer, some cut up
gouda, and a Blueberry muffin waiting upstairs.  "Happy Mother's day"

"... or not!  I don't want to violate our pact of not doing things for
each other."

"I've liked the small little things.  I'll always accept those."

"OK, so we're amending the pact?"

"Yes - no planning required.  Just small things throughout the day.
I'll accept this."

Planned upcoming work around the house.  Set a goal for this week to
put down grass seed in the backyard, and even some hay.  "Hay is ugly,
and a pain in the ass, but at least Rodney will be able to play out
there, that's the most important thing."
