title: notes for today
---

Practices much better time management yesterday.  Got up at least once
an hour, and remembered to completely unplug for lunch time.  And of
all things, switching back to my dainty little flower coffee mug
helped the most.  My Bears mug holds a lot of coffee - I can get
through a whole morning while only refilling it twice.  But using a
smaller mug, I have to get up way more often for refills, and it makes
for a natural & healthy rhythm in the morning.

For lunch, made Rodney a PB&J.  I heated up the last of the pizza and
made a little bowl of fried rice, stirring in a drop of ghost pepper
hot sauce.  I scarfed it down at the table with Rodney, letting my
nose run into a napkin while he watched in amusement.

Headed downstairs to advance the bread to the next stage.  It had
poofed up to a wonderful gurgling pale sponge in the bowl over night.
Gave it a few flips with a spatula, then turned it out onto floured
plastic.  After watching the video again, made sure to do a very
specific move in which you run your hands underneath the dough to
stretch it out longer.  This time, I also used table salt in the
recipe instead of kosher salt.  Left it on the counter under a towel
for a few more hours.

Got Rodney out of bed.  Headed downstairs to hang out in the studio
with Mom.  She was trying to level a new work table.  Rodney started
bossing me around, and out of amusement I went with it.  "C'mere dad,"
ushering me over to a pile of boxes.  "We need the balloons."  Dug out
a bag of balloons from a box, "you can pick _three_".  Balloons are
another miscellaneous item that we've conjured into some kind of
behavior incentive.  It's funny how, if you commit, you can get kids
excited about anything.  I blew up the balloons for Rodney, and he ran
off bumping and chasing them around the basement.

Had a video call with Alex and Cassie.  We all brought drinks to a
virtual happy hour.  After letting Rodney ham it up on camera with a
few toys and a balloon he was playing with, caught up on their
personal life.  They were in good spirits.  I like hearing how other
people are coping and adapting this life.  Compared and contrasted our
new homebound routines.  Also teased myself about how I sliced the
ciabatta loaf wrongly the first time I made it.  "It's funny how you
can put so much effort into something, and then screw it all up with
one bad decision."

"They looked like little biscottis," laughed Marissa.

Marissa joined me in the kitchen while I made dinner, sitting on the
counter beside the stove.  Ziggy started crying and wagging her tail.
I picked her up and placed her in Marissa's lap, and she slept there
for the next hour while I lazily cooked.  I fried some bacon and set
it aside on a plate, wiping the pan out with paper towels.  "I can't
believe she's comfortable here," said Marissa patting her head.
"You've got bacon cooling like 10 inches from her face."

"She's just trying to set a precedent for sleeping on the counter
while we have food out," I laughed.

"Do you think she's tricking us, and she's going to wait for the
opportune moment for us to let her do this again, then she'll end up
eating a whole chicken or something?"

"Plausible," I said.  "She's smart enough to think about the _long_
con."

Took the bread out of the oven.  Turned out beautifully, especially
now that I know how to properly slice it.  Cut a third of the load,
then cut it in half and assembled sandwiches.  Also heated up some
baked beans.

Marissa ordered Rodney a set of dominos to play with.  jingle.  After
dinner we sat at the table, setting them up in runs.  Rodney, of
course, lacked the patience to let the line get any bigger than ten in
a row.  He leaned onto his belly, lunching across the table to
greedily tap them with his finger.  We made up a little jingle:
_dominooooooos_.

Sad about the dogs, especially Ziggy.  We can tell she misses running
errands with Mom, and she misses agility.  "Ziggy definitely knows
something is up," said Marissa.  "She used to leave the house with me
a few times a week."  She seemed sad today, spending most of the day
curled up in a ball in her chair on her blanket.  Just like we have
good days and bad days with this whole thing, so do the dogs.

Outside looked so creepy.  Burger King light was turned off.  No cars
or people walking on East Wash.  Nothing but a distant train further
east of us.  "I didn't even know there was a train over there."
Uncomfortable, asked "want to go inside now?"  Darted inside and
locked the door behind us.  Never thought I would miss the sound of
cars whizzing by on East Wash, and the sounds of people loudly
bantering as they walk by on the sidewalk.  The quarantine is
demonstrating how many comforts I actually had in my life.  No noise.
Just ominous, stale, poisonous silence under a crushing night sky.

"Let's go somewhere tomorrow," I said.

"We can get icecream?  Or we can just pick up Culver's together in the
drive through."

"Yeah, I have to pick up groceries anyway.  And it's a pretty big
list.  It would be nice to just eat out after putting everything
away."

Hugged Ziggy extra tight.  The dogs definitely know something is up,
and I just wish there was a way to tell them that it won't last
forever.
