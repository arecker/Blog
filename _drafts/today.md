title: notes for today
---

A little peeved with Madison.  There is a growing, swirling ocean of
garbage growing in my shed.  I dread taking our garbage out, because
it means I have to tend to it and prune it.

Sort of miss parties.  We threw some good parties.  When this shit is
over with, let's throw a big party.  A _human party_.

Back on Amstel Light.  Wandered away a bit and bought a case of PBR,
and it was a mistake.  I've been drinking it like pennence.  After
drinking light beer for so long, PBR makes my stomach sick, like I
just chugged a 2 Liter bottle of Mountain Dew on a dare.  Amstel Light
is the superior beer, always.  It's practically the La Croix of beers.

And Rodney was glad that I was back to Amstel as well.  I remember the
first time he saw the PBR cans in the fridge, he was immediately
bummed he couldn't practice opening it for me.  Today, he opened the
fridge and brought a Diet Coke to Marissa and a biertje for me.  I
think if he brings me a beer every day, we're cool, no matter what.
