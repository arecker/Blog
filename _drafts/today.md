title: notes for today
---

Hung out outside in the front yard and drank coffee.  Marissa felt
motivated to mow the lawn, and after she dragged it out of the shed, I
wandered over to help start it.  Several pulls of the dusty cord
yielded nothing.

"I mean... it's been sitting in the shed all winter.  That's gotta be
bad for it, right?"

Stopped for a minute.  "I don't really know how engines work.  What's
your understanding of what's going on right now?"

Marissa shrugged.  That meant the reigning theory was still just _pull
harder_.  Two hands on the chord, a foot on the back wheel, and a
sharp full body twist.  The weak engine sputtered, and Marissa engaged
the magical morse code needed oh the handles to turn the sputtering
into a roar.  The engine roared, and Marissa coasted away.  The old
craigslist lawn mower lives to fight another day.

Made pasta, and Marissa fixed a salad.  Ate on the deck, and as it was
starting to get chilly, moved inside to eat some ice cream.  She
handed me a bowl with two scoops of icecream and two loose peanut
butter cups.  Instinctively, before digging into the vanilla icecream,
I plucked a peanut butter cup off the top and ate it.  Marissa looked
at me in horror.

"You're not going to mash it?"

"Was I supposed to?  I thought it was just a freebie."  Laughed.
Sometimes I question my own instincts.  Sure - I think it's safe to
say a normal person would just start mashing the peanut butter cup
into their ice cream.

Put Rodney to bed.  I was impressed, he actually had a few questions
for me.  Usually when he says "I have lots of questions for you," he
doesn't, and he's bluffing, and he's just trying to pad the bedtime
routine with extra minutes.  "What did you play with today?"  Good
question.  Today I played around with code on the computer, and I
played outside with you for a bit too."

"I have SO many questions."

"OK go for it.

"Um... I don't know."  

"And there it is, OK g'night dude."

"Are you worried we're not going to remember how to take care of a
baby?"

"Nah, I think it will all come rushing back."

"But there's so many things to know.  Like I couldn't remember if
you're supposed to put a onesie on underneath pajamas."

Leaned back in my chair on the deck thinking of a response.  "It is a
lot.  I definitely couldn't, like, list everything off in a fact
sheet.  But it's all stuff that will come rushing back when you're in
the moment.  You'll know what to do, instincts have probably let you
remember more than you think you know."

Went through some baby gear and started to get the kitchen organized.
Decided to take on the onerous task of sorting our baby bibs, and we
have way more than you'd think.

"This is nuts.  We have probably hundreds.  How did we get so many?"

"People like to give them as gifts.  There's a lot of cute ones out
there."

That was probably why we had upwards of a hundred baby bibs scattered
throughout the table.

Sorted them into piles: practical, cute, and trash.  After the great
baby bib culling, got it down to a manageable stack for the drawer.

Helped Marissa cut the dogs nails.  Understandably both Ollie and
Ziggy get kind of antsy around electric spinning nail grinder.  And
with the added challenge of Marissa's late term belly, took some
thought to find a way to hold the dogs in a comfortable, workable
position.  Sat facing each other, touching knees forming a dog
hammock.  Both Ollie and Ziggy fell asleep so deeply that they didn't
want to move.  Especially Ollie.  "I hadn't seen him that relaxed
since he was a puppy.  He was weightless for a second there."  He
holds the weight of the world on his shoulders, and I think he forgets
to relax sometimes.
