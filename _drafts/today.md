title: box forts, difficult conversations, and beers in the driveway
---

Stand-up in the morning.  Zoom was having some trouble, so to save
bandwidth we all turned off our cameras and went with just audio.
Learned something about myself.  When my webcam is turned off, I can
do a pretty decent Trump impersonation.  Started to drone on about
work stuff with Trump's voice.

> We're building thousands of new servers in Amazon.  Thousands.
> Amazon said its the most they've ever seen.  Jeff Bezos - wonderful
> guy, great leader - said it's the most servers they've ever seen.
> Just a beautiful cloud platform they have.

The team just kind of let me run with it for a minute or two.  Most
fun I've had all week.

Spent most of the day working on some docs.  Marissa and I had coffee
together.  "Maybe we should make it a rule at coffee time that we
don't talk about corona?" she laughed.

Even bringing it up in a joke, we got to talking about serious fears
and concerns, and things got a little heated.  "That was a tough
conversation, but a necessary one," I said.  "I'm feeling close to you
right now."

What we found yesterday while talking is that this is a tough time for
everybody.  The reality of a long term quarantine is setting in, and
now is not the time to question or challenge the things people
consider important to them.  Let people make their own sacrifices in
their own time, and we have to be patient with one another.

He and Marissa were building a box fort in the living room.  Marissa
was cutting notches in the sides for windows while Rodney was
scurrying in and out of the swinging cardboard door.  I climbed inside
with him.  Heated up some leftovers and made Rodney a PB&J.

Had our first "tea time" at work, which was just a meeting dedicated
to chatting and catching up.  Fun to joke around about stuff, but I
was kind of distracted with the second Madison news conference last
afternoon.  "People in the youtube chat are expecting a total
lockdown," Marissa said to me.  "lol, I hid the YouTube chat and you
should do the same," as it was just a slew of misinformation.
Thankfully, Evers didn't announce a total lockdown, but the
restrictions for group gatherings were made even more strict, and
restaurants are down to drive through only.

Made a trip to Hy-Vee.  This would be our last stock-piling grocery
trip, picked up cans of fruit and vegetables, canned fish, sweet soy
sauce, and luckily reaching all the way into the back of the aisle at
Hy-Vee I was able to scrape the last three boxes of _Frozen_ shaped
Mac 'n Cheese.

I have to reiterate.  The people working in grocery stores right now
are heros.  I've seen the same set of people working each time I've
been in Hy-Vee.  God knows how many hours they're pulling right now,
but I'm thankful for them.  Grocery stores are the heartbeat of a
community, and when times are good, and we have restaurants and
takeout food to amuse us, that's sort of easy to forget.

Zoom session with the family yesterday.  Fun to see everyone.  Rodney
was feeling pretty rascally, so after seeing everyone Marissa put him
to bed.

Received some light teasing for my microphone.  "You dominate the
conversation whenever you talk."  Started hamming it up with the
'podcaster' act.

Apparently my parents have been meeting with Kelly and Sarah to have
beers on their driveway.  "We stay six feet away, have just one beer,
then leave."  Laughed, enjoying that mental picture and think that's
really cool.  I've heard about people meeting up for beers remotely,
but doing it in the driveway also sounds pretty cool.
