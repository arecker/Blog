Shared this fact with a few people, but I read that the WHO is trying
to get people to switch out the term _social distancing_ with
_physicial distancing_.  This is supposed to emphasize the fact that
the socializing is still an important part of life.  I'd argue it's
even more important now.  In a world of physical distancing, social
interactions are no longer free.  There's virtually no possibility
you'll bump into a neighbor or family member unintentionally and have
a minute to catch up.  Every interaction - even the small ones -
require effort, planning, deliberation, and worst of all, video
conferencing software.

Productive morning.  Jumped back into code, cleaning up my work for
the week so I could give a smooth demo in the afternoon.

Joined Marissa and Rodney at the table for lunch.  Heated up some
Chinese food, breaking into the second order of orange chicken.  Or so
we thought it was orange chicken.  "I still think this might be tofu,"
said Marissa holding a shred at the end of her fork.  "It's hard to
tell after it's reheated."

Decided to take the dogs out on a walk.  Easy to forget how nice the
weather is getting outside.  Breath of fresh air, took off down our
street.  We decided to walk all the way to the end of the block.

With physical distancing, walking can get tricky.  We got into a few
awkward stand-offs with people walking towards us.  One of us would
either have to stand off to the side of the curb while the other
past.  Further up our street, there was an older lady tending to our
garden.  "Don't come any closer," she called out visibly upset.  "We
know," said Marissa.  "We'll keep our distance."  I nodded at the
lady, then we moved back onto the sidewalk.  After she was a few
houses behind us, Marissa and I talked about the encounter.

"I feel like she was madder than she needed to be," said Marissa.

"That's true," I replied.  "But this is a freaky time right now,
everybody's dealing with it in their own way."

"Yeah," said Marissa.  "Poor lady was probably just stressed out.  And
I don't blame her, walks are kind of stressful."

Physical distancing is getting kind of complicated, and I expect it to
get harder in the summer.  "We'll be able to go more places as the
weather gets nicer, but we'll all have to practice this physical
distancing thing.  Maybe they'll have big plastic bubbles for us to
sit in at the biergarten," I laughed.

Just before our meeting ended, threw out a suggestion.  "Nate, do you
use iMovie a lot?"  Nate laughed, "Recker, when I volunteer to do
things, most of the time I plan on _stitching together my parachute on
the way down_."  The team broke out into laughter over the funny
visual.

"I like the attitude, but I can do the edits if you want.  I do this
stuff for Marissa all the time."  Bid the team farewell for the
weekend, then stayed online a little bit longer to slice the videos.
Interesting watching myself give a demo.  Each time I present
something, it feels like I have a whole new arsenal of public speaking
tics.  At some point in my career, I started taking sips out of my
coffee to emphasize my point, ending just about every sentence with a
rhetorical _right?_, and I constantly shrug.  I shrug after explaining
things, I shrug after jokes, and sometimes I shrug after I shrug.

Burnt out from the work day.  And since we already decided on making
frozen pizza for dinner, I decided to recuse myself to the basement
for some video game time.  After about a half our, I returned and
started tidying up the kitchen while waiting for the oven to preheat.
To satisfy our family's diverse and divisive frozen pizza preferences,
we were making one Home Run Inn pizza and a Digiorono pizza.  I
strolled into the living room, scooping up a football and tossing it
to Marissa.

"I think the cooking apron and hoodie combo is your best outfit,"
laughed Marissa, tossing the football back to me.

I wear my cooking apron around the house constantly.  I've even fallen
asleep on the couch while wearing it.  It's my unofficial home
uniform.  I wish I had copies of this outfit.  I could wear black
Volcom sweats, a black Adidas hoodie, and a cooking apron every day of
my life and never feel like I was missing out on anything.

The oven timer rang, and Rodney and Marissa filed into the dining room
for dinner.

Frozen pizza tasting contest.  Cut two little squares for Rodney and
set them on a plate.  "OK Rodney," I said so seriously, it was almost
the same as my scary discipline voice.  "We need to know which of
these you like better."  Rodney dutifully nodded.  Ate the first, and
nodded.  Took a bite of the second, and Rodney violently flinched.
Opened his mouth in pain before quickly swallowing it.  "That was the
response to biting something hot I've ever seen."  I laughed, "We may
have voided this test I think, but we'll ask anyway.  OK dude, which
is your favorite pizza."

"This one," Rodney said pointing to the Digiorono.  Marissa spun the
plate quickly in circles.  "OK Rod," she repeated.  "Which one do you
like better."  Rodney pointed to the Digiorono again.  "Dude, you're
your mother's son with this one," I said.  "Eh, nobody likes Home Run
Inn.  Or at the very least Home Run Inn people are weird.  I saw a
thread like this on Facebook, and the Home Run Inn pizza people were
the ones saying things like _if you don't like home run inn, you're
dead to me_."

Went on a crazy coding binge last night.  Had an ambitious IT ticket
on the board and threw it out a few days ago.  But it's been nagging
me, and last night I decided to just go for it.  Marissa had lots to
do as well, so it was a work night.  Hung out in the basement with her
while she painted.

Watched a few more episodes of Tiger King.  For yesterday's entry, I
had a whole paragraph of thoughts about the show, and I'm glad I held
off.  The show does a really nice job getting you to question who the
villains and heros are in the story.  Only three episodes in, frankly
I'm afraid to declare loyalty to even the lady running the tiger
sanctuary.  "So they're all weird!" I yelled at the TV, throwing my
hands up.  "Everyone's shady!"

Learn about kings and emperors from a thousand years ago who kept
tigers in their courtroom.  Can't help but wonder if we let these big
cat people just do their own thing, would they eventually become
warlords?  Maybe if Xerxes or Nero were born today, they'd just be
another wacko living in Florida defending his right to own 500 tigers.
