Read "You are my I love you."  Very sweet book.  Rodney was quiet
while I read.  After finishing I set the book on the nightstand.
Rodney continued staring up at the ceiling pensively.  In the quiet of
his room, he reached his his finger up toward the ceiling, then rested
it on my face, inching it closer to my eye.  "Dada I touch your
eyeball...".  Felt his sharp nail poke my eye and I winced in pain.
"Please?" he asked, trying to sneak it under my eyelid.  Spent the
next five minutes laughing.
