title: notes for today
---

Not going to lie to you.  Work has already started to wind down.  All
I contributed yesterday was just being a warm body in meetings.  And
now that all of our meetings are via zoom, can I even say I was a warm
body?

Kind of surreal to think I'm heading into such a long break.  I wasn't
prepared to disengage.  Rather than dipping my toe into the waters of
being home all summer, it appears without even realizing it, I opted
to just belly flop into it.

Ate lunch on the back porch.  Breezy in the shade, we zipped our coats
and huddled up.  This time, they caught me taking a picture of them at
the table eating lunch.  So Marissa lifted her arms up in the air and
grinned.  Rodney joined in too.  "I feel like I always look so mean in
your photos."  That's fair.  Candid photos do a good job of capturing
a setting, but at least around our house, it makes it look like
everyone our house spends most of their time staring into space.

Bided my time the rest of the day.  Taking a break in the afternoon to
play baseball with Rodney, and then throw the football with Marissa.
Then we went for a walk.

"We should talk sometime about what the new daily routine is going to
look like," I said.  "I'd like to keep things as organized as
possible, just to make sure I don't mentally waste away without work.
And I know I get carried away with hobbies when I have nothing else
going on."

"That would be nice.  We'll sit down and go through it."

Made a weird bacon and potato soup for dinner.  I wasn't a fan of how
it turned out.  I have a tendency to use up every ingredient around
me.  This works in my favor (and for whomever I'm cooking for) in most
meals.  Plenty of cheese.  Plenty of meat.  Plenty of heat.  Plenty of
butter.  I cook like a true glutton.

But soups, that hard and fast glutton lifestyle will get you into
trouble.  I started with plenty of onion, plenty of bacon, plenty of
potato, and then - _ope_ - looks like I need to add more broth.  Way
more broth.  And following this line of thinking I have no choice but
to water down my delicious soup just to contain the mountain of
potatoes I've added.  Soup is tricky because you're not just making a
fixed amount.  You're making a concentrate.

"Lower your expectations," I announced.  "This is edible, but it's not
going to change your life."  Out of all people, Rodney really liked
it, lapping up the warm broth out of his plastic bowl like a dog.

Unexpectedly, Marissa took care of me the rest of the night.
Especially heinous, since I said I would put Rodney to bed.  And one
of the worst sins to commit as a parent sharing responsibility over a
bed time routine is the "I'll do bed time tonight headfake."  Said I
would do it, then Ziggy crawled into my lap and melted - I didn't
stand a chance.  Suddenly it was a lazy night.  Caught up on youtube
channels.  Closed my eyes on the couch with Ziggy.

Marissa even tidied up the kitchen too.

"I feel bad that you're taking care of me.  This wasn't planned I
swear."

"It's OK.  I got a long nap in.  You know how important my naps are."
Once Marissa gets one long nap in her, she basically turns into
Ironman, or maybe even the robot maid from the Jetsons.  And I was
getting the sense she was enjoying channeling her nesting instinct.
