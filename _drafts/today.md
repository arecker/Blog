Marissa's art show in the morning.  House looked lovely.  Set Rodney
up in his room with extra toys and even a little toddler radio.  He
looked quite content, and actually eager for me to close the
door. Before the art show began, we joked about all the horrible ways
to derail the art show if we chose to.  "Like what if I just really
casually referred to you as _fatso_, or we got in a huge argument and
then just suddenly stopped and went back to being sweet?"

"It's fun to think about isn't it?"  but Marissa respects her fans to
much to mess with them for her amusement.

Finished the gallery, and Marissa in relief grabbed a bag of easter
candy and crashed on the couch for a nap.  I lounged on the couch
watching youtube.

In kind of a bread rut.  Third attempt at a french baguette didn't
work out.  Although Rodney helped me grate cheese on it and turn it
into a burnt, but still very delicious ciabatta.  Marissa sensed I was
kind of depressed and hung out with me in the kitchen.  "Quarantine
shopping and cooking is kind of wearing on me.  It's difficult keeping
variety, especially when the bread isn't working out."

Starting cooking red sauce and pasta.  "I'll be ok," I said putting my
head over the pot and smelling.  Red sauce puts me in a good mood.
Ate spaghetti on the back porch and started to feel better.  "I just
hit a low point for a second there."

Took a walk to the liquor store and bought some beer and a lemon drink
for Marissa.  Trixie's has added big Plexiglas shields, colored tape,
and signs that get the "no browsing" point across in a very charming
way.  I kind of miss chatting with the people there.  They look really
bummed out, and I don't think they recognize me while I'm wearing a
mask.

Sat outside, and watched some videos of the rallies in other cities in
disgust.

"Read about the Spanish Flue.  Did you know it was at its worst when
America thought it was over?  The parades they threw to celebrate it
caused the worst of the outbreak."

Discouraged hearing about the protests.  I don't know what's
compelling people to protest a virus, but a virus has nothing to do
with freedom, for God's sake.  Protesting the stay at home over seems
like the stupidest thing in the world to me.  Suck it up and do your
part in keeping people safe.

Marissa and I hung out in the kitchen.  She baked a batch of peanut
butter cookies.  I snacked on cookie dough and formed some of the
cookies into very juvenile shapes.  The first batch came out of the
oven, and without thinking I grabbed the sugar and dumped it all over
the cookies.

"WOAH, what are you doing?" snapped Marissa.

"Sorry, I just had an impulse.  I really feel strongly that these
cookies should be tossed in sugar."

Marissa paused and studied the cookies, picking one up and inspecting
the sugar.  "OK," she said.  "It's actually sticking to the cookie.
And it makes the fork grid pattern look much better.  Do the rest."

That was a close one.

Got the last batch of cookies into the oven, and felt an impulse to
try bread again.  Marissa said "I want to help."  Opened up Bruno's
video and began translating ingredients.  Very tricky, but together we
moved carefully through the steps.  "I swear, if this recipe works,
I'm laminating it and sticking it to the wall.  I'll make this every
night."  Beautiful fluffy dough resting in the fridge.

Spent the rest of the night organizing the fridge and pantry and
making a grocery list.  Appreciate Marissa's help.  Quarantine grocery
shopping is my least favorite part of life right now.  I hate the
pressure of curating food for the next two weeks.  I hate the giant
grocery list, and the pressure to find things in the right order while
maintaining distance from other shoppers.  I hate the huge amount of
money at the checkout aisle.

"Are we buying bread?" said Marissa seated at the computer beside me.
Paused for a moment.

"No.  Let's bank on us figuring it out.  I'm sick of buying bread."

"Yeah," nodded Marissa.  "I feel so picky, but I just don't like any
of the sandwich bread they have.  I want to figure out how to make
it."
