title: notes for today
---

Had an outage in our staging environment.  Nate and I jumped on a Zoom
call together.  Kept debugging and trying to fix things.  Staging
environment doesn't impact any customers obviously, so not a real
emergency, but important enough to stick with it until resolved.
Outages have a weird way of soaking up all the time in the day.

Before I knew it, it was two, and Marissa was bringing me up a
sandwich, a beer, and a slice of red velvet cake.  I groaned, suddenly
realizing how hungry I was.

Marissa chatted in the kitchen with me while I prepared dinner.  She
wheeled our office chair in.  "I can't sit on the counter anymore, I
have to bring a chair," she laughed.

After keeping my nose to the grindstone all day, it was nice to
reconnect.  "Thanks again for bringing me up lunch.  That was an
amazing moment."

"I think you literally didn't get up from your chair all day."

"Once, in the late morning, to get a stroopwaffel.  And I think I also
went to the bathroom at some point.  It was the outage, it makes you
really lose track of time.  And plus, I had a day off yesterday."

"How did that make things different."

"I was all relaxed.  It's like I was bringing the Monday morning kind
of hustle to a Friday afternoon.  I was literally on a Zoom call like
all day with Nate.  Oh and Alex joined in too.  It was an interesting
issue, just took a lot of time to figure out what was going on."

Continued chatting while I cut up a chicken.  Had it thawing in the
fridge, and although I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it, I
at least knew I needed to get the bones out to make stock.

"I can get the spine out really well," I said holding my knife over
the cutting board, dripping with wet blood.  "But I'm not going to
lie, the breastbone gives me trouble.  I feel like it turns into a bit
of a massacre."

Marissa looked on at the carcass, visibly squeamish.  She glanced down
at her bowl of frosted flakes.  "Is this going to ruin frosted flakes
for me?"  I laughed.

"I think I'm just going to grill these," I said moving the salted
chicken quarters and breasts to plates.  "We can hang out outside, it
will be awesome."

Rodney got up from his nap and joined me outside to build the grill.
Together we filled the chimney lighter with charcoals and doused a
rolled up piece of cardboard with lighter fluid.  "OK, watch this
dude," I said leaning in close to the cardboard, flicking the lighter
with my thumb.  Rodney looked on with wonder as a brilliant orange
flame overtook the open grill.

"Even though fire is pretty cool, it's dangerous and you have to be
careful.  Don't do this stuff unless I'm here." I said, locking eyes
to make sure the lesson landed.  Rodney nodded.  "Got it!" he replied
before happily galloping away into the backyard.

Placed the chicken quarters on the grill after seasoning them with
oregano, rosemary, garlic powder, and olive oil.  I opened two cans of
asparagus spears and dumped them into a sieve.  An unappetizing green
mush tumbled into the sink.  Perplexed and disgusted, I probed the the
mixture with a spoon, looking for pieces that actually resembled an
asparagus.  I normally have pretty good luck with canned vegetables,
but I should have known that canned asparagus was indeed too good to
be true.  "Corn it is..." I muttered, dumping the remnants into the
garbage can.

Finished the chicken, leaving the thighs and wings to sear over the
fire while I sliced into the chicken breasts and cut up some
focaccia.  Rodney wanted to eat outside, and even though the sun went
away, we bundled up to oblige him.

"I feel like such a carnivore," said Marissa, carefully holding her
fingers over the plate, dismantling a chicken thigh."

"Yeah, it kind of reminds me of eating at Boston Market.  It was so
messy, I'd have to wash my hands, wrists, and arms in the bathroom
right after eating."

"I loved Boston Market.  That was my favorite place to eat," said
Marissa.

Tidied up after dinner and made our way upstairs.  We had another Zoom
session, this time with my college friends.  I joined the call and was
greeted by a large grid of tired faces, headphones, and late night
drinks.  "I barely recognize some of you," I laughed.  "Beth, who is
that grizzly looking dude next to you," I said, teasing Ben.

Nice to see everyone again.  I think I spent more time laughing then
talking.  Marissa led an informal round of questions for each person
on the call, and we made plenty of time for ribbing in between.  Also,
Zoom virtual backgrounds were a huge hit.
