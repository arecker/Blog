title: notes for today

Had a small brunch on the couch while we watched church on YouTube.
Rodney and Marissa had a big bowl of Colossal Berry Crunch, and I had
a fried egg on toast with hot sauce.  Finished church, but still
didn't feel like getting on with my day, so hit 'play' on a pretty
inane video called "Best Trick Plays of the Decade!" from the NFL
channel.  "Might just be having _de ja vu_, but I'm pretty sure I've
watched this video on a Sunday morning while procrastinating
something.

Got ready with Rodney.  He was jazzed we were going somewhere, even
just putting jeans on put him in a good mood.  We both put gel in our
hair too.

Brewed some more coffee and Went for a long walk with the dogs.
Marissa heard about this pop-up toy store this couple was doing out of
their house, so we headed in that direction.  Sort of weird to see
that the bike trail was more congested than Atwood Road, and it kind
of makes me worried that they'll have to put restrictions on going for
walks.

Arrived at the house, which was in the Jenny Street neighborhood.
Puzzles, kites, and bubble kits set up.  Rodney had a hard time
understanding the social distance thing, but stayed on the sidewalk
with Mom.  "Made it rain."  Picked out one of all three.  They had a
pretty good system - Marissa approached the porch and laid her debit
card on the stairs and walked back to the end of the driveway.  The
lady punched it in while wearing latex gloves, put everything with the
card in the bag, and placed it at on the driveway.  We collected it,
thanked them, and headed home.  Rodney held the kite in his lap on the
way home.

Put Rodney down for quiet time.  Cracked his window, set up his puzzle
on his desk and left his door cracked.  Marissa came down fifteen
minutes later while I was preparing the pizza.  "So _bingus_ lost his
open window privileges," she said in a huff.  "He kept shutting his
toys in there and trying to peel the paint off.  Stinkin' boys."

Marissa painted in the basement while I cooked a sfincione.  I'm
finally starting to get the hang of the civil war flour.  I still
don't like the way it tastes, but at least I've figured out that in
everything you need to use slightly less of it since it's drier.  The
sfincione came out of the oven a little strange, floppy and stuck to
the pan.  I had to wildly scrape it free, and I admit that out of
anger I abruptly dropped the pan on the stove making a loud clatter in
the house.

Before putting Rodney to bed, we decided to give him some time outside
with the new bubble set we bought.  Marissa opened the packet, holding
it out to me.  "Look, it's just dish soap," she laughed.  

"I'm glad we didn't buy refills," I replied.  "We can just use Dawn or
something."  Marissa and Rodney ran into the backyard.  Marissa used
the strings to make a long bubble that rolled to the floor and popped.
"I remember the guy being able to make more than one bubble at a
time," said Marissa, looking at the sticks and soapy string puzzled.

"Here, let me try," I said.  Have you ever come across something that
you are inexplicably good at on the first try?  I make bubbles - it's
what I do.  "I think if you make a cinching motion like this, you have
more control over them", I said demonstrating.  Rodney ran after the
bubbles, swinging at them with a baseball bat.  "Show Rodney how to do
it," she said.

I made a bubble with Rodney, but he lost interest.  "I think he'd
rather just chase them.  Here, I'll go to the deck and throw them down
to you."

Moved to the deck.  Soon had big bubbles rolling all over the yard.
"Look, I'm like the end boss of a video game.  But just the first
level, since bubbles aren't that scary," I said.

Put Rodney to bed.  Finished my last chore of the week, cleaning out
our coat closet.  We've been keeping our dog costume bin up on the top
shelf, and we had some interesting artifacts up there - costumes for a
dog chicken, dog spider-man, dog sonic, dog sheep, bow ties,
snowshoes, and a whole bunch of dog sweaters.  Struck me that we are
indeed weird dog people.
