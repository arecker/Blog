title: notes for today
---

Had to pivot priorities for the foreseeable future because of an
outage.  But weirdly gave me some energy.  After a very fragmented
work week, it was nice to all come around the same common priority.
Spent the day quietly researching, drifting in and out of meetings.

Heated up the leftover orzo pasta for lunch.  Rodney joined me on the
couch for a snuggle and we watched some youtube videos together.

Went for a long walk around the block in the afternoon.  We had some
drama trying to get Rodney to put on his new spring jacket we ordered
in the mail.  Was frustrated by his stubbornness about trying on new
clothes, and it finally boiled over into a confrontation in the
kitchen.

"This is your new spring jacket, dude.  We want you to wear this one
when it's nice outside," I said.

Rodney got misty eyed and began to pout.  "But my brown one."  He
helplessly pointed to his brown jacket.

"Your brown jacket?  What about it?" I asked.

"I want to keep it," replied Rodney rubbing his eyes.

"Oh dude, do you think we're getting rid of it?"  Rodney nodded.  "No
dude, this jacket is awesome, we're keeping _both_ of them.  You'll
still wear the cool brown one when it's cooled outside."

I flung the door open, letting the cool breeze fill the kitchen.  "See
how nice it is outside?  It's _too warm_ for the brown jacket right
now, so we're going to wear the spring jacket.  But look at this
dude."  I grabbed his spring jacket and hung it on the hook beside his
brown one.  "Warm outside?  _Spring jacket_."  I jabbed a finger at
the grey zip-up hanging on the hook.  "Cold outside?  _Brown jacket_."

Rodney reluctantly put the zip up on.  "You'll get used to it, dude.
Remember when you didn't like your new Bears hat at first?"  All
winter, Rodney insisted on squeezing his head into his spider-man hat,
even though it was one size too small.  We encountered similar turmoil
around getting him to start wearing a larger, warmer Bears snow hat.
We even cut off the little _babooshkah_ on top and the knitted tassles
on hanging on the sides, trying to make it look more like his beloved
Spider-man hat.

Discovering that we can talk Rodney down from things.  He's not a
toddler anymore, where the only option is to just muscle through
things and hope he gets on board.  We can reason with him now.  And
maybe he follows the reasoning, or it's possible that he just
appreciates the effort of coming down to his level and making sure he
knows the plan.

Went for a long walk around the block.  Rodney looked adorable in his
new zip-up.  Marissa and I whispered to each other while he ran ahead
to collect sticks off the side walk.  "Look at him," I said.  "He
looks like a bratty European soccer player."

Marissa laughed.  "He's a little college kid now," she said.

So fascinated by bread lately.  And I either it's much easier than I
thought, or I just have a knack for it, but every loaf we've tried at
home has been pretty good, and better than the stuff I usually buy.
And the really silly part about this bread experiment is that I have
at least a few books on bread on my bookshelf that I have yet to crack
open.  To be honest, I'm having more fun just testing my own theories
and figuring it out on my own.

Yesterday was a french loaf.  No sugar, just salt, water, yeast, and
flour mixed with cold water.  I kneaded and folded the dough until it
was smooth, but left it very sticky.  Let it proof in a pan in a warm
oven before baking it, and it turned out wonderful.

Have the other following theories:

- The more slowly the yeast easts, the more complex the flavors.  I'm
  leaving a dough ball in the fridge for a whole 24 hours to test
  this.
- The less you touch the flour and dough, the better.  To test this, I
  left the dough ball kind of lumpy, stopping after giving it a rough
  stir and very quick, sticky knead.

Sometime today, I'm going to take out the dough ball and _try_ to form
it into a baguette.  My bread hot streak has got me feeling really
confident.

Had a near miss though.  I wandered downstairs to borrow Marissa's
plastic water spray bottle, and apparently I've never really gotten a
good look at it because I grabbed the wrong one.  Coming up the
stairs, I tried it on my hand and got a strong whiff of chemicals.  My
hand was sticky and slimy.  "That was my varnish, I'm really glad you
didn't spray that all over the bread."

Feels empowering, and a small positive thing to come out of the
lockdown.
