title: notes for today

Decided to tackle making chicken stock.  Had bagged up the chicken
bones (both from cutting up the whole bird, and even the wings and
thighs from when we finished eating).  Eager to earn the "homemade
stock merit badge", and see my new stainless steel stock pot in its
element.  Dumped in the chicken bones and offcuts into some water with
carrots, celery and a bay leaf.  Scum rose to the top of the bubbling
mixture, and I stood over it attentively skimming it into the garbage
can.  Efforts paid off, as the scum disappeared, and the solution was
so clear you could see the bottom.  After a few hours, I strained out
the solids and transferred it to a smaller pot to reduce.

Chicken stock is an interesting taste.  You're not supposed to season
it with salt, so by itself it's tastes like chicken tea.  Left the pot
simmering to take the car to Walgreen's for Marissa to pick up a
prescription.

Turned the key.  The car was dead.  Felt my face turn flush and ghost
white.  I hadn't even thought about our car.  Waited in the driver
seat for a minute thinking of a course of action, trying not to get
overwhelmed.

"Our battery is dead," I said walking into the house.  "Crap." said
Marissa.  I stood there for a minute leaned up against the kitchen
doorway.

"I'll text Alyssa and ask if Trent can fix it," she said, pulling out
her phone.

"OK, for know I'll just walk to Walgreen's."

A few minutes later, Trent jogged down the front steps of the house
beside us.  I fumbled around the driver seat of our car to pop the
hood.  He slipped his way between our car and the wall to reach the
outlet.  I took a few cautious steps backwards.

"I feel like such a dick backing away from you, but you know we gotta
keep social distance."

"No it's OK," he laughed.  "I get it."  Marissa joined us on our back
porch.  Soon Alyssa did to, holding their dog Grasshopper.
Grasshopper and Ziggy sensed each other's presence, even obscured by
our backyard fence.

"So how's work going, Trent?" asked Marissa.

"Pretty good," he said.  "I actually feel pretty bad, it's a great
situation now.  We canceled all the events, so I don't need to work as
many hours and I don't talk to people.  I just go, take care of the
monkeys, then I'm home by one.  It's actually the most fun I've ever
had at work."

"Go figure," I interjected.  "The work is at its best when there's no
people to deal with."

"And how are you holding up, Alyssa?  How is school going?" ask
Marissa.

"Not great," she said.  "I was supposed to be starting my rotations in
surgery, and we're not sure what UW is going to do.  But they're
probably going to try to do it online.  I'm not sure how that's going
to work, but I'm having trouble adjusting to online learning."

I turned the key, and our car roared to life.  I gave a fist pump.
"I'd leave it on for like a half hour or so," said Trent, winding up
his battery charger.

"Thanks again, guys.  You're a life saver.  Let's get a social
distancing beer sometime."

Marissa and I stood on the porch.  It was lightly misting outside.

"Do you have anything in your life that you really should take better
care of, but you haven't gotten around to it yet?"

"Oh of course.  Give me a second I can think of a good example."

"For me it's my paint brushes.  I feel so wasteful because they get
hard and crusty and I have to throw them out.  I wish I took care of
them like you take care of your knives."

"Well I'm pretty lucky," I said.  "Knives are a lot easier to take
care of.  I sharpen them once a month and wash them by hand."  Thought
for a moment.  "But I get it.  You're an artist.  It's your passion.
You expect yourself to be on top of that kind of thing."

"I'm going to file it away for next year's New Year's Resolution."

I cracked a smile.  "Come again?  _Next year's_ resolution?"

"Yeah," replied Marissa.  "Next year, I'll make that my New Year's
Resolution."

"That's good," I laughed.  "Give yourself plenty of time to work up to
it.  Can't be starting on that now, we're already too far into the
year."

"Aha!  My white t shirts," I said snapping my fingers.  "My shirts are
kind of expensive, but they turn yellow and get so crummy that I have
to throw them away."
