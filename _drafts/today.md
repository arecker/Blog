title: notes for today
---

Dug into a script at work, which seemed to cure my bad mood.  "I'm a
really simple person," I laughed with my boss during a 1-on-1.  "I
just need to write a little bit of code everyday, otherwise I get kind
of restless."

Jumped into another meeting set aside for "tea time".  Brewed a cup of
tea, and was geared up to be social, but there was no one there.
Laughed to myself in a single person Zoom chat.  Left the call and
used the time to catch up on YouTube instead.

After work, it was the hour of bodily fluids.  Rodney had an accident
his his room during his nap.  Normally these aren't a big deal, but
being the third day of our no diaper strike, there was an ordeal that
had to be dealt with.  After cleaning him off in the tub, the two of
us went downstairs to start on dinner.  We passed by the living room
just as Ziggy puked on the carpet.  Acting fast to keep the bright
yellow puke from soaking into the carpet, we soaked the stain with
cleaner and warm water.

"OK are we good?  Are all the babies in this house done shitting and
puking now?" I asked.

Rodney and I eagerly filed into the kitchen to begin dinner.  I had a
fun idea where we'd borrow some latex gloves from Marissa's studio and
cut up the whole chicken.  Kind of a fun, gross activity that a little
boy stuck at home might get into, and bodily fluids were already sort
of the theme of the day.  Rodney stood on the kitchen ladder, ready
with a butter knife in his hand.  I removed the chicken from the
fridge.  "Solid as a rock," I muttered to myself.

"Yeah," echoed Rodney enthusiastically.  "Solid as a rock!" he gave
the butterknife a few swings in the air.

"Ugh, this sucks, dude.  I'm sorry, I don't know what happened.  This
chicken has been in the fridge for two whole days, I have no idea why
it's not thawed by now."

"Yeah this _SUCKS_," parroted Rodney.

But we managed.  We thawed some chicken sausages from the fridge,
cooking them with mushrooms and onions.  As I got to work, Rodney
climbed onto the counter to sit.  Lately he does this thing where he
hits the overhanging pots and pans with spoons to make music, and how
could I deny him of that?

I turned away from him to slice mushrooms into a bowl.  As I worked, I
heard more and more clanging and shuffling behind me on the counter.
"What's going on over there," I said turning around to see Rodney
standing on the counter, leaning over the counter to reach a drawer
with a pair of tongs.

"Oh no you don't.  OK we're done, dude." I snapped.  I hoisted Rodney
off the counter and he walked away from the kitchen, shoulders
slumped.

Before finishing the night on the couch with some TV, cleaned the
kitchen and made a batch of bread.  Marissa hung out in the kitchen
working on dog tricks.  She found a set of certifications you can get
remotely by sending in videos.  "You just send the judge videos of
your dog doing tricks, and depending on how many tricks they know and
how advanced they are, you can earn ribbons that way.  You're even
supposed to make a skit or play with your dog to demonstrate them."

"We still have those doggy Spider-Man costumes in the closet I think,"
I laughed.  "We could edit in dialog from the movie, or stage an
upside down Spider-Man kiss."

Making beer bread.  Pointed out that we needed something to settle
with our alcohol system.  What about the leftovers from beer bread?
