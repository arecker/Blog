title: notes for today
---

Busy day of work.  In an out of pairing sessions, following up slack
conversations, design meetings.  The work day flew pretty fast.  I
think I finally got to the point where Zoom meetings just feel like
meetings now.  There's no longer any novelty to joining from home.  It
just feels like work, and that's a very good thing.  Although usually
a few times a week, somebody will joke about my microphone and
extendible arm setup.  "Are you starting a podcast Alex?" is a common
one.  Yesterday during our engineering meet-up I decided to run with
it.

"For a small monthly fee, contributors to my patreon will gain access
to all my premium content - soothing bedtime stories.  Right now I
have two books available - _The Little Prince_ and _The Communist
Manifesto_, so check it out, mash that like button and ring that
bell!"

I get a lot of teasing for my microphone, but I remain steadfast in my
recommendation.  Even before the quarantine, I'd call it the best $20
I've ever spent.

Took a break to eat lunch with Rodney.  He suggested mac n cheese, so
we headed into the kitchen to make some.  This time, I decided to jazz
it up with a splash of milk and some shredded gouda.  I was going to
be good yesterday and eat the leftover salmon loaf, but the smell of
the melted cheese seduced me, and I ended up just eating a bowl of mac
n cheese with Rodney instead.

Headed into the kitchen to cook dinner.  Marissa painted on the deck
while Rodney played outside.  After getting the potatoes, onions, and
bacon into the oven, I joined them outside, grabbing some sliced
carrots from the fridge.  Rodney joined me at the table.

"Rod, show dad what you were coloring with today," said Marissa.
Rodney grabbed his colored markers.  They were special markers fixed
with a circular stamp that left clean & bright circles on the page.  I
grabbed some markers and a blank sheet of paper and joined in, dabbing
a pattern.

"Oh, that's very abstract dada, good job," said Marissa.  I held up my
painting for Rodney.  "Check it out," I said.  "It's the big dipper!"

We ate dinner outside.  Rodney was distracted waving at our neighbors
across the backyard.  He kept trying to loop them in our conversation.
"GUYS?  GUYS?  ARE YOU THERE?  Oh, Hi baby," he said, spun around in
his chair.

After dinner, went for a walk.  Could see people standing in driveways
staggered in circles.  "I saw on our neighborhood page that the
neighborhood wants to start a new thing where at 7 every evening, we
all go outside and wave to each other.  I think that's what's going
on."  So interesting to see.  I could tell that not everybody new each
other very well, but by now the isolation must be driving people to
overcome any shyness they have.

"One with a tail, one without!" a neighbor called out as we passed,
referring to our Corgis.

"6 feet is two corgis, so they're a good reference point for us - six
feet!"  laughed Marissa.

Rodney chimed in.  "Six feet, ha ha!"  Marissa and I smirked at each
other.  "It's so funny that's where is brain is right now," she said
to me in a hushed tone.  "He just wants to join in on the joke."  I
smiled, watching him wander ahead of us holding a stick in his hand.

Skyped Mimi and Pappa when we returned, and it was great to chat with
them.  "We've had a busy week of Skypes," said Marissa.  "Almost one
every day."

"Yeah, it's been a pretty socially draining week, you know?  I think
this weekend we're just going to lay low.  I think we need just a
weekend at home, you know?"  Mimi and Pappa laughed, picking up on my
sarcasm.

We chatted for a bit longer, and Rodney's tiredness finally got the
best of him.  He squirmed in my lap, kicking his legs, trying to spin
his way out free like a crocodile before giving up and just pouting
with his head buried in my shoulder instead.

Finished up the evening catching up on some YouTube videos.
Regrettably, we caught up on football and cooking shows beforehand and
ended the night on a Last Week Tonight episode on Coronavirus.  We
like staying informed, but the reality of the situation put me in kind
of a somber and agitated mood.

It's been a rough few days.  Trying to keep my spirits, but I'm
feeling the tiredness and sadness creep in this week.
