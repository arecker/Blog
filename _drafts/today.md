title: notes for today
---

Found some time in the morning to work on a project.  Cleaning up our
family photos.  Google photos is great for just backing everything up
in a reliable place, but it can be a bit exhaustive, especially as
Marissa's art photos get synced up there, and usually we take a four
or five pictures of everything.  Set up an album of favorites that
gets automatically synced to our computers as rotating wallpaper.  A
fun project, because I think anything that helps us enjoy old photos
is time well spent.  Sort of like my version of scrap booking.

Oven is driving me up the wall.  Wouldn't light yesterday before
dinner.  Thought I figured it out and it was because the washer was
running.  Marissa even confirmed they're on the same circuit.  Stopped
the washer and it still wouldn't light.  Questioning if it's even
broken.  "Maybe it's always had a hard time warming up and we never
noticed.  I usually just walk away and let it do it's thing.  Maybe
it's not broken."

Lost my temper over it.  Feeling ripped off.  Feeling like I just
rolled over and let the repair guy take my money without doing
anything.  Feeling like I don't understand enough of the problem.  And
also of course, feel cheated that this happened in a time where
cooking has to be planned in advanced.

Met on the porch for a beer.  "This one is going to be a really weepy
one, just warning you," as we were getting Miles into a new onesie to
meet outside.

Stopped in the kitchen to slice of some bread, which turned out after
all.  Munched on bread and drank beer on the back porch.

"It was a rough one today.  Feel guilty about losing patience with the
dogs.  Took them on a walk, but I was a little tough on them.  It was
like I was in dog trainer mode the entire time."

"And you feel like you kind of wasted your own little slice of alone
time?"

"Yeah."

"I feel guilty that I kept Rodney inside all morning and we didn't do
anything fun.  Thanks for playing outside with him."

"How about we do high's and low's?"

"Good question."

"My high was playing sports with Rodney in the backyard.  It was
really fun to connect with him.  My low is probably how I'm feeling
now.  I'm tired, and I'm still sore.  I'm angry at how hard this is on
my body.  I feel like I spend all day just feeding him."

"I got some good me-time in today.  It was fun working on our
automatic photo gallery, I made some good progress on it.  Also the
bread is exciting.  The starter is working really well.  Low is
probably the oven.  I'm disappointed that I lost my temper over it,
and I feel like we're just stuck - it's not quite broken enough to fix
or replace, but I don't have confidence in it."

Silently chewed bread for a minute.  "You were right.  We just need
more data points.  I'll just have to try making a loaf of sourdough
bread every night until we get a better sense of how often it breaks."
