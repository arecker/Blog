title: notes for today

Carved out some time in the morning to work on code.  Rodney was
content playing with toys, and Marissa was still getting ready to
leave for a Miles' doctors appointment.

"Geez, I forgot how much work it is getting a baby out the door.
Would you mind helping?"  Rodney and I helped strapped Miles into the
car seat while Marissa grabbed a diaper bag.

Played sidewalk chalk outside with Rodney.  At first I was content to
just sit there and drink coffee.  My head was still adrift thinking
about the side project I was working on, but finally agreed to pitch
in on the mural.  Contributed by drawing a Spider-Man head.

Rodney started to excitedly jump around.  Told me to draw the neck, so
I added a neck, a chest, arms, and legs.  Before I knew it, we had a
whole life sized Spider-Man standing in our driveway.  Rodney and I
finished it off by writing the words _HANG IN THERE MADISON_ beside
him.

"It looks really good, I'm impressed," said Marissa.

"Got carried away with it.  Not only did I completely forget about
Friday story time with the cousins, but we also used up like half of
the chalk Rodney got in the mail."

"I can tell you spent a lot of time drawing Spider-Man."  I nodded.
"But I was never able to master perspective, or depict him doing
athletic things.  Which is why I'm basically limited to drawing him in
anatomical position.

Marissa returned from the doctor with a good recommendation for Rod.
Picked up some Miralax from Hy-Vee and after returning, got him set up
on the couch with some _special Gatorade_.  Finally did the deed
during his nap time which followed.  Immediately fell asleep, and by
the time I let him out of his room, Rodney was visibly in a good
mood.  In fact, he attacked me with ninja swords while I was in the
kitchen.

"You're SHREDDER," he said, spearing me in the back.  I smiled.
"Dude, are you feeling good?  I haven't seen you play swords in a
really long time.  How is your stomach?"

"Yeah!  _Tummix_ feels good."  Scampered away, looking light on his
feet.

In the kitchen, prepped dinner along with a loaf of bread.  I was
excited about this batch because it was the first batch with my
homemade sourdough starter, which our neighbors generously fed while
we were staying at the hospital.

The transformation was fascinating.  Over a week by simply dumping out
half every night and refilling with flour and water, it went from
smelling like _oude schoenen_, to a faint sourdough smell, to a
beautiful and complex fruity bouquet.  And each time I would shove the
Tupperware container in Marissa's face for a whiff, it would take an
act of faith to trust me that the suspicious beige colored substance
wasn't going to make her barf.

"What's the name of the little brain guy from Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles?" I asked Marissa.

"_Krang_.  Why?" she said without looking up.

"I still haven't named our starter yet.  You know it's a living thing,
and it deserves a name.  We'll go with _Krang_."

The bread last night was close, but didn't quite turn out.  The loaf
failed to rise in the oven, and we were left with a heavy, doughy
frisbee.  As Rodney was stabbing it with a butter knife while I was
finishing dinner, I almost threw it away, but figured we'd sample some
just for fun.

We all thoughtfully chewed a piece of the dense bread at the table.

"Mmmmm," said Marissa.  "The flavor is really good."

"Yeah," I said.  "I'm surprised.  I think I just need more starter."

"So don't take this the wrong way, but wouldn't it be easier to start
with... a recipe?   I mean I think it's cool that you're just trying
to arrive at it from experimentation, but..."

I leaned back in my chair and widened my eyes.

"Sorry," said Marissa interrupting herself.  "Was that mean?"

"No," I replied.  "That's a fair question.  In other words, wouldn't
it be easier to start with a recipe that's already been documented to
work?"

Went for a long walk around the block with Miles.  Before heading out,
Rodney grabbed a beer from the fridge and gently placed it in the
bottom compartment of the stroller.

"What's that, dude?" I asked.

"That's a _biertje_ for Dadda," said Rodney.

"How thoughtful of you, dude," I laughed.  "This time we're only going
around the block, but you have good instincts."
