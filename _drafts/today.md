title: notes for today
---

Rough day of work.  Couldn't finish anything yesterday, and halfway
into the workday I felt like I had just spent the whole day bothering
people.

Yes, work isn't linear.  It's not like burning calories on a
treadmill, or eating an elephant.  Some days you finish three days
worth of work, and other days you set yourself back day.  I get
restless and grumpy when I can't point to at least one concrete way
I've added value to something.

Went for a walk around the block.  Marissa sensed that I was
frustrated and did a fine job giving me space.  "Did I contribute to
your mood in anyway?"  What a compassionate question.

"Nah, it's just work.  I just need to walk it off."

Back at home, finally found something of value to do, tried to log
into a server, and realized that my VPN credentials expired.  "And
that's a wrap," I said getting up from my chair.

Marissa was outside.  Joined her on the back porch at the table,
leaned my head back to let the sun wash over me.  Played football in
the yard.

Cooked dinner.  Curated meals continues to be a challenge.  How do you
balance equal use of resource with variety?

Haven't maid saucijzenbroodjes in a while, and it was fun to break out
that recipe.  Hard to imagine that it used to take me an hour to form
them and get them on the table.  It took me practically twenty minutes
this time around.  Baked the rolls next to a loaf of beer bread.  Also
used the leftover meat filling and puff pastry scraps to construct a
mystery ball, which came out looking pretty good, and Rodney happily
ate it cut up like a deconstructed sausage roll.

Working out.  Stalling at 30 push-ups, 30 sit-ups, and 5 chin-ups.
For any given week, one of these is easier than the others.  Yesterday
grunted my way through the last five push-ups.  Is 30 my max?  Beyond
that, would I have to start drinking protein shakes or drinking raw
eggs like Rocky?

So much TV to watch.  Marissa and I are chipping away at it, but we
don't have enough time in the evenings to put as big of a dent into it
as we used to.  But whether you lap it up quickly, or burn it down
slowly, TV is still a wonderful distraction from everything going on.

Finished better call saul last night.  It's been a pretty stressful,
but artful season and I'm appreciative of it.  As usual it will be a
long wait.  Next on this list, we're finishing the Good Place.
Sometimes kind of an obnoxious show.  Lots of filler material,
followed by quick plot twists.  Realized that most of the fun in the
show is just learning their theory of the afterlife.  Expect to be
disappointed.

Also need to start on _The Last Dance_.  Showed Marissa the
documentary trailer on my phone.  "So it's about the Bulls?  I don't
get it, what happened?"

"When Michael Jordan played for the Bulls, we won six championships.
Two runs of three in a row.  It was a pretty crazy time - the Bulls
were almost like a cult.  We used to throw parties for the games.  And
from what I can tell, most people agree that the Chicago Bulls were
the greatest basketball team to ever play."

"I love how seriously your family is taking it.  Look, your mom says
she went back to rewatch the first two episodes."

Laughed.  "Yeah, it's almost like a Bible Study.  Speaking of which,
we need to get on that, I don't want to be out of the loop next time
we Zoom with everyone."
