title: notes for today
---

Great day of work.  Finished my "paper" and got it into the "teacher"
with plenty of time to spare.  Of course it wasn't really a paper, as
much as it was a help center article, and the teacher being a
technical writer at our company.  And unlike high school, rather than
shredding the essay with a red pen and a demoralizing wall of
corrections, she made the inline edits herself and sent them back to
me.  We're told school was meant to prepare you for the real world,
but isn't it funny how often the real world is more forgiving than
school?

I found a typo or a grammar mistake in your writing?  No problem - I
know how to use Google docs, I'll just fix it myself for you.  Are you
going to slip on a deadline?  No problem - I know it's important to
you, and I understand you have other priorities.

There's a letter sitting on the nightstand beside where I work.  Funny
story - about a week ago it was accidentally delivered to our house,
and it sat on the coffee bar downstairs for a few days.  When I was
finally ready to take a little walk down the street to deliver it, I
sat down at the computer to look up the address.

"I think it's an 9," I said.  Marissa leaned in to study the envelope.

"No, that's an _8_," she said.

"Really?  Have you ever known anyone to write an '8' like that?"  I
spun around in my chair as my rant continued.  "Even if you draw your
8's incorrectly... where instead of making a figure eight with your
pen, you draw two circles stacked on top of each other, they would
never turn out like _that_.  That would have to be drawn like a... a
backwards three."

Marissa shrugged and walked away.  "A crap," I said.  "If it is an 9,
that's going to be a long walk - that's all the way at the end block."

Yesterday, Marissa set the letter on the night stand beside my desk.
"I told you it was an eight," she said smiling.  So at some point
today, I'll need to take another walk around the block.

As Marissa said yesterday just before retiring for the evening,
"Rodney did not want to be a kid today."  He was involved in every
action, discussion, and movement of ours.  After finishing up the work
day, while I sat at my computer hacking on a side project, Rodney
lobbed blocks at me from the cracked door of his room.  One hit me in
the back of the head, and I shot him a cartoonishly angry face.

Headed downstairs to crash on the couch until dinner, letting Rodney
follow.  Rodney was practicing bottle flips in the living room, and
seeing me snap some pictures of him, he wandered over, reaching for my
phone.

"Dada, gimme phone," he said.  Normally our policy as parents is to
only honor demands when prepended by a nice, Midwestern _please_, but
I wanted to see where we was going with this.

"I take a _snapshat_," Rodney said, staring down at the screen,
fiddling with the buttons.  The screen went black.  "Ope, what
happened?" he said handing the phone back to me.

I set him up with the camera.  He held the phone in one hand while
doing flips with the other.  It became clear he was mimicking me.
I've been using Snapchat to save my best quarantine bottle flips in
hope of putting it all together in a highlight real someday.

"_Just kidding it's a bottle flip_," he said in a bellowing voice,
dropping the bottle to the ground.

I usually ask Rodney questions before bed.  I quiz him about what he
ate, what he played with, and even what TV shows he watched.  I have
to think that taking a minute to reflect on the day is a healthy
exercise for his little vibrating brain.  Last night he turned the
tables.

"Dada, I have _krenchins_ for you," he said.  He still struggles with
the 'q' sound, so _questions_ becomes "krenchins".

"OK what do you got," I replied.  Rodney fell silent.

"Um... I don't know!" he finally said after a moment of deliberation.
Seeing Marissa pass in the hallway snatched away his attention.

"Oh momma!  Hi!  I have krenchins for you," he said repeating himself.

"Oh is that right?" replied Marissa.

"Yeah!  I have SO MANY krenchins," he continued.  Rodney jumped to his
feet and flapped his arms, bulging his eyes, his antics earning an
easy laugh.

"Dude, your crazy," I said.  Rodney turned toward me.

"Dada, waabout my..." Rodney paused, searching for the sounds to make.
"_Verssker DEElin_?"

"Dude what did you say... OHHHH," I answered.  "You want me to tuck in
_jouw verschillinde kleine zachte dieren!_" Rodney's eyes lit up.  He
was trying to say a Dutch phrase I use to refer to his animals: the
_your various small soft animals_.  I got to hand it to him for
trying, although if he can't even say _questions_ yet, I don't know
what made him think he had a chance.
