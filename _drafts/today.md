title: notes for today
---

Absolutely burned rubber in the morning.  Woke up at usual time, and
it worked in my favor.  By the time Rodney was up, I had already
brewed coffee, cleaned the kitchen, finished my journal entry for the
day, and even wrote a bit of code.  A tough bullet to bite, but I'd
like to transition to being one of those people that wakes up at the
same time.

The timing was almost perfect.  As I was proofreading, Marissa getting
ready behind me reminded me that the oven repair guy was coming
sometime between 9 and 11.  Glanced at the clock and saw that it was
8:55.  "Perfect", I thought.  "That's just enough time for me to
publish this, and maybe even set up Rodney with some breakfast,
and...".  There was a sharp knock on the door.  Passed by Rodney
waiting at the doorway of his room.  "Stay in bed a little longer
dude, OK".

Threw my mask on and let the repair guy in.  I was not prepared to
explain anything to him and I think it showed.

"So what's actually the issue here," he asked, climbing down onto the
kitchen floor.

"It wouldn't preheat the other day, waited for about twenty minutes
and it was still cold." I explained.  He began to dismantle the
inside.

"So I took it apart like you're doing now and..."

"Did you strip this screw?" he interrupted.

"Um... no, but I had trouble getting it off too." I replied.

"I can see that," he chuckled.  I continued my train of thought.

"And that... um... so I went to light it with the door open and saw
that..."

"It won't light with the door open," he interrupted again.  He toggled
a little button in top corner of the oven door frame.  "See that's a
safety switch that will shut off the burner."

"Ah OK.  So I guess any evidence I gathered after that is void," I
added.

He went on to explain that the oven probably didn't start because of
some metal pans I had stacked up in my warming drawer.  "The igniter
will short on a metal pan instead of lighting the element," he went
on.  "Did you stack more pans in here?"  Suddenly I felt like he was
scolding me.

"No, the way the drawer looks now is how it always looks."  I just had
two pans and a silicone mat inside.  The repair guy shrugged and
started to re assemble the oven.  He stopped and wiped his forehead.

"Jesus," he sighed.  "This thing is not even that old.  What the hell
did you do to this thing, it looks terrible."

I started to feel agitated.  "I learned to cook on this oven - I tried
a lot of things, and some of them didn't work out."

The repair guy gave me a suspicious side eye.  "OK, that'll be a
hundred bucks."  I imperceptibly rolled my eyes with my back turned,
and handed him my debit card.  If you ask me, that's a steep price for
a twenty minute interaction for a tip about opening the warming
drawer, especially one padded with scolding, man-splaining, and oven
shaming.  I just wanted to get him out of my house.

"Well the oven is fixed," I said returning upstairs.  Marissa was
changing Miles.

"What was wrong with it?" she asked.

"Nothing.  Or maybe something.  No way to know, but it costed us a
hundred bucks", I sighed.

Marissa went back to bed with Miles, and Rodney and I hung out on the
main floor.  He watched TV while I coded.  About an hour later,
Marissa joined us downstairs and I started on lunch.  I cooked some
hash, and Rodney helped me dice the potatoes.  Marissa joined me in
the kitchen after he left - just in time to enjoy the smells of
potatoes turning crispy in bacon fat.  Ate lunch, and Marissa gave me
the all clear to take a nap.

Played with Rodney in the afternoon.  Went outside and did the usual
roulette of sports.  Played baseball for a while, and Rodney finally
graduated to hitting my overhand pitches.  Just now getting to the
danger zone where I expect more wiffle balls to make their way over
the fence.

Returned inside.  Parents treated us to some takeout.  Heard the
delivery guy drop it on our porch, and waited a minute for him to
leave.  Marissa cracked open the door and shrieked.  "Ah!"  Loss for
words.  "Squirrel!"  Picked up Ziggy and peaked through the door just
in time to see a squirrel reaching his arm into the takeout bag and
making off with a chicken nugget.  "Mamma my chicken nugget!  Squirrel
got my chicken!"

"We can't feed him that," scolded Marissa.

"Why not?" I replied.  "OK I'll google it.  OK, obviously I can't find
anything chicken tender specific, but there's a thread about eating
tomatoes with squirrel bite marks in them and..." I chuckled,
realizing that the gardening forum I found was hardly authoritative.

"George says _what doesn't kill you makes you stronger_," I laughed.
"Tom says _It depends on how hungry you are_."

Arrived at a very superstitious compromise.  Sectioned off the tip of
the nearest chicken finger to the entry wound of the takeout
container.  Microwaved the rest of the plate.  We stood in the kitchen
watching the plate spin in the microwave.  I stared down at the notch
I cut off the chicken.

"So is your thinking that the squirrel delicately reached his arm in
there and only touched what he wanted to eat?  Because a wild animal
definitely wouldn't just..."  I stabbed my arm forward and spun it
wildly in a circle.  Marissa laughed.

Had a beer on the back porch.  Talked about the day, struck a good
balance.  "My morning was perfect."  "My afternoon was perfect."  A
good system.

Ended the night by watching some YouTube with Miles swaddled up in my
lap.  I think it made Ziggy a little jealous, and she snuggled up as
close as she could get.  But who doesn't like being fought over?  Kind
of a perk if you ask me.
