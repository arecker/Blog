title: notes for today

Wrapped up journaling our epic struggle to vote for Bernie Sanders,
only to find out that he dropped out of the race the next morning.
After throwing a small tantrum in our family's politics slack channel,
I was able to come around and appreciate the irony in the timing.
Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook exploding with discussion.  Do we _Vote
Blue No Matter Who_ or ought we be _Bernie or Bust_?

Marissa and I have enjoyed discussing politics lately.  Yet another
good distraction from being stuck at home.  As long as things don't
get too real.  These days it's easy to mentally pull the thread and
find yourself in a really sad place.

Made some quesadillas for lunch out leftover fresh mozzarella,
leftover grated cheddar, and a little baggie of cilantro that was
hanging out in the fridge.  Fried them in butter, sliced them up, and
put them on a cute little serving tray for Marissa and Rodney before
heading upstairs.  Satisfying hearing them dig into the platter while
I climbed the stairs with my bowl of leftover-leftover stamppot and a
_biertje_.

Busy work day continued.  In and out of meetings.

Made sandwiches in the kitchen.  Discovered a love of making them.
With sandwiches, it's really easy to introduce variety.  Ingredients.

Wrestling with Rodney in bed.  Sweeping his leg so he'd fall.
Flipping him upside down.  Landed strangely and stood up, worried with
his shoulders locked.  "Aw, did you get the wind knocked out of you,
it's OK dude."  Quick hug and we was back to fighting.

Trying to get Rodney to reflect more on his day.  After calming down
from fighting, asked about his day.  "What did you watch on TV today?"
"Um... X-men and Story Bots."  That's a good start!  And what did you
eat today?  "Peanut Butter and Jelly."  "Not quite."  "What happened
when you fell on your bed?"  Started to lecture me, saying "Dada, it
was so high.  Too high."  Oh sorry dude.

In the evenings, Marissa and I are still plowing through the old early
2000 era X-men movies.  We're thoroughly enjoying them.  They're old
enough where they don't feel like the contemporary Marvel movies.  Not
so formulaic, and take some chances.  And I was surprise that coming
back to these, I was surprised to find that my least favorite things
about the movie are Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman.  At the time, these
people seemed like obvious candidates to play, respectively, Storm and
Wolverine, but the only thing they have going for them is they _look_
the part.  Personality wise, Hugh Jackman is like the whimsical
Broadway musical version of Wolverine.  Or maybe he's the edgy high
school drama version of Wolverine.  But as long as Ian Mckellen and
and Patrick Stewart are on screen, those two single handedly elevate
these movies.

Also had to eat my words last night.  Since we watched the first one,
I had been telling Marissa that the actress that plays _Mistique_ was
Jennifer Lawrence.  "It's a weird role for her, isn't it?" I rambled.
"She doesn't talk much."  The movie went on, and as it became more and
more clear that was _not_ Jennifer Lawrence, I dug a deeper grave for
my ignorance.  "Oh I think she sounds weird because they got someone
else to do the voice for her.  Yeah it doesn't look like her because
of all the makeup."

_Mistique_ is not played by Jennifer Lawrence.  For once it would feel
great to look at a IMDB and be proven right for a change.

Birthday planning.
