title: notes for today
---

Skipping a morning shower is a great move during this whole quarantine
thing.  Instead of showering, I just sat at our dining room bar and
stared out the window.

I think I need a weekend.  When you're in your house all the time,
it's easy to overlook how tired you might be.  I think this week, if I
were bouncing between the office, the grocery store, and any other
errands I'd normally do, I would have taken a long nap yesterday.  But
since I'm around the house all day, I think subconsciously I assume
I'm not tired.  What I'm trying to say is remember to take naps and
relax, even if you're stuck in your house.

A very academic work day.  Had written up a design proposal, and spent
most of yesterday answering follow-up questions and defending it.  I
think remote work is making me a better work writer.  And I don't
remember the last time I spent a whole work day in the same google
doc.

Didn't see Marissa and Rod much throughout the day.  "I knew you were
focusing when you didn't come down for lunch until 12:30, and you were
so excited about the sandwich you made."

"That's true," I said.  "I got going and lost track of time," I said
digging into it from the couch.  Ninja Turtles blared from the TV, and
Rodney was snacking on a cut up sandwich and sliced vegetables from
his box fort.  Yes, the box is still sticking around.  Actually kind
of convenient.  Rodney can enjoy snacks inside without worrying about
Ziggy stealing things.  She circles the box fort in frustration,
sometimes putting her paws up on the holes we cut for windows.

Ventured out to Hy-Vee.  The outside world is still doing well.  Sort
of weird watching people actively avoid being near each other.  Just
close nit groups of people walking with their head down.  "I sort of
felt like _Ofred_.  What's that show with _Ofred_?"  I was frustrated
that the name _Ofred_ was the only thing I remembered about it."

"Ah, Handmaid's something?"

"That's the one.  Everyone just has their head down while they're
shopping."

Marissa commenting on how weird it is that this is something that
everybody in the world is thinking about and fearing.  Weird that she
can just say 'stay safe' to strangers on Instagram, and trust they'll
know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, I got an email from Stephan from
the French Cooking Academy, and he opened it with _here's a cheap
recipe you can do while quarantined_.

Made fried rice.  This time, I opened the throttle on the heat, and I
wasn't shy with the butter.  Threw in all the celery and carrots that
Rodney didn't eat for lunch as well as a handful of cabbage.  Don't
want to get in a food rut, and we've already had long discussions
about my beloved daily grocery trips.  "I think if I'm going to go out
less for food, I need some easy and repetitive meals to take the
pressure off.  Like this rice took twenty minutes to make, I played
video games with Rodney in the basement until then."

Had a remote session with Mimi and Poppa yesterday.  Nice to see them,
and Rodney was excited as well.  Gave them a tour of Miles' room, and
Rodney showed off all the games we've been playing inside.  Got so
excited, started throwing his stuffed animals into the air and
shattered a lightbulb.  "We'll have to call you some other time," said
Marissa in a subdued panic.

Put Rod to bed.

Show and tell with Marissa.  She showed me Miles' baby room.  She
painted the ceiling, and in accordance with the space theme, she went
with a light swirling black.  "It still looks 'space', right?"  Yes.
Drew some cartooney planets and rocket ships, and I was very insistent
she included a flying saucer.  "Well Miles is kind of like a little
space alien.  I hope he comes in peace," I said giving her protruding
belly a pat.

"It's more you.  The last one looked nice, but it wasn't you.  It was
too _floofy_."

"Yeah," I said finishing her thought.  "And this one might not look as
nice, but it's more me."

You know for someone who wears the same colors every day and detests
most things about the modern web, I even surprise myself with how
picky I can be.  Bagged the theme I was using and went back to just
plain HTML and CSS.  Also broke things out into smaller pages like
"stats" and "contact".  I changed the font type and style, giving the
text a little more room to breathe.  Made it a nice off black color so
it would be easier on the eyes.  And all the custom scripts I wrote to
publish entries to twitter and slack are bundled up in a nice little
jekyll plugin.

Ended the night by watching more of my movie pick.  I really screwed
this one up.  "I really liked _Invincible_ when I first saw it.  I
don't know what happened."  Watching this movie is like getting a root
canal without anesthesia.  And the holes are dizzying.  Isn't
Philidelphia kind of a big city?  Why is Vince featured on the news
every single night during training camp, and everyone knows him like
they live in Nebraska or something.  And why doesn't anyone sound like
they're from Philly.  Seriously, Mark Whalburg sounds like he's really
leaning into his Boston accent.  Why did he break up with Elizabeth
Banks again?

"You need to be _invincible_ to make it through this movie," said
Marissa slouched on the couch.
