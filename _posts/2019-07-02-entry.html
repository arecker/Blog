<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>I had such a productive day yesterday.  Nothing feels as good as
  putting together a to-do list and actually finishing it before the day
  is done.  We&#8217;re in full party planning mode for Rodney&#8217;s birthday this
  weekend.  I think we&#8217;ll have fewer people this year, but something
  tells me it will still be a really good time.  Smaller parties can be
  more fun - certainly for me, as that would mean I just do less
  floating around.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I also tooled around with my new blog format a bit more.  I
  arrived at a template I like.  Now it&#8217;s just a matter of writing
  something that will parse journal entries.  My plan was to write an
  external program in python or something, but I&#8217;m having a hard time
  finding an org mode parsing library in anything other than elisp worth
  its salt.  The options out there are pretty dismal.  So it&#8217;s looking
  like I&#8217;m just going to have to put my big boy pants on and figure out
  how to do the filtering and templating all from elisp.  I was looking
  to just get this thing out the door and start using it, but little
  adventures in elisp are fun too.  Mostly, I&#8217;m looking forward to the
  added challenge of writing public journal entries.  As I may have
  mentioned before, not <i>all</i> of them will be published - only those I
  tag &#8220;public&#8221;, just in case I need to rant or I&#8217;m just not writing
  coherently that morning.</p>
<p>Today is a pretty big cooking day.  I&#8217;m going to be packing our cooler
  for concert on the square tomorrow, provided my veggie dumplings work
  out.  This will be the first recipe I&#8217;ve tried from the famous
  &#8220;peaceful cuisine&#8221; YouTube channel.  Will it be as uneventful and
  serene as the video?  Time will tell, but the recipe is so simple,
  it&#8217;s hard to imagine what could go wrong.  Maybe the dumplings will
  explode once I drop them in hot water.  Maybe since they just have
  cabbage, onion, and mushroom in them, they won&#8217;t be filling and we&#8217;ll
  run out of them immediately.  Or maybe they&#8217;ll taste wonderful, and
  they&#8217;ll join the ranks my tried and true recipes, earning the coveted
  &#8220;vegetarian&#8221; tag - that&#8217;s a very exclusive group.</p>
<p>Well, with the few minutes I have left this morning, I&#8217;m going to take
  another wack at a blog function.  Let&#8217;s have a great Tuesday!</p>
