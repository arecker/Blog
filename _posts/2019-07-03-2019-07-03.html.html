<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful morning today - the kind of morning where it&#8217;s so
  bright outside, it almost feels like you&#8217;re being beckoned out of bed
  to go make coffee and get going.  Yesterday&#8217;s dumplings turned out
  really good, and I just checked them a minute ago, despite cooling
  down in the fridge, it looks like for the most part they didn&#8217;t glob
  up into one giant dumpling.  Making the dumplings also turned out to
  be a fantastic and fulfilling two person job, and it&#8217;s fun to see how
  good you can get at rolling the little dough circles flat, or crimping
  them together over the filling.  I think those are going to be really
  tasty this evening.  I was planning on serving them cold right out of
  the cooler with a bit of soy sauce mixed with rice vinegar.</p>
<p>As an aside, I&#8217;m really enjoying the challenge of making cooler
  friendly vegetarian recipes.  It&#8217;s really pushing me to try things I
  normally wouldn&#8217;t, and plus it&#8217;s a great excuse to pig out on
  Wednesday during lunch, knowing I&#8217;m getting a healthy home cooked
  vegetarian dinner.  But let&#8217;s be honest, we both know that the second
  I get home, I extend the excuse and permit myself to wolf down a few
  leftovers from the night before.  And right now there&#8217;s a single taco
  from taco bell with my name on it.</p>
<p>Work was a real bummer yesterday.  I spent all day trying to get
  something to work, and it&#8217;s sill not working.  I do my best to uphold
  my personal belief that any programming language will work and you
  should just keep the programming language tribalism to yourself, but
  that being said, I just don&#8217;t understand the point of 80% of the
  mechanisms in ruby.  All the needless object oriented behavior and
  stupid syntax sugar on everything just make it so painful to work
  with.  I&#8217;m making a point to just shut up about it and get it done,
  because I should know how to do this stuff.  And let&#8217;s be honest, I&#8217;ve
  had to do much worse.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m staring out the window trying to think of the worst
  programming I&#8217;ve ever had to do, and I caught myself and decided I&#8217;d
  rather be in a positive place.  Deep breaths.  Positive thoughts.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters is cooking, anyway.  Marissa and I sat
  down the other day and made a game plan, a menu, and a grocery list.
  Despite being on a holiday weekend, the guest list for Rodney&#8217;s party
  is filling up!  I think it will be a little more intimate this year,
  but I&#8217;m expecting a handful of neighbors will swing by.</p>
<p>So today, I&#8217;m working from home.  Then we&#8217;re all going to walk over to
  glass nickel for lunch and a beer.  Then this evening, there&#8217;s a
  special concert on the square in which - word on the street - they&#8217;re
  going to be firing off a cannon during the 1812 overture.  I think
  it&#8217;s going to be a good day.</p>
