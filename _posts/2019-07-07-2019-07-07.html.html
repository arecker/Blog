<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Well, Rodney&#8217;s birthday party was a wonderful time.  Today he came
  down the stairs after his nap and said &#8220;where did friends go?&#8221;.  Maybe
  I&#8217;m reading into it too much, but I was impressed that <i>friends</i> were
  his first thought, especially since he had a living room full of new
  toys to play with and a fridge filled with chocolate cake.  &#8220;You&#8217;re
  friends went home, but they&#8217;ll be back later, dude&#8221; I explained.
  Construction may have been the party theme, but <i>friends</i> was the real
  theme.</p>
<p>I normally write these in the morning, but I was battling a serious
  hangover, making breakfast, and trying to get everyone out the door
  for church on time.  Our good friends Adam and Sam spent the night.
  It was so wonderful to catch up with them and meet their puppy, and
  they were very gracious to rush out the door with us this morning.
  After church, we went to Graze with Mimi and Poppa, and a few bites of
  their kimchi hash was enough to quicken my party-weary body with life
  again.  Well, maybe <i>quicken</i> is an inaccurate.  It put me in a good
  enough mood to take a long nap.  A good nap.  The kind that&#8217;s a full
  REM cycle, and since it&#8217;s the middle of the way you have weird dreams
  and it feels like you&#8217;re coming out of a cryogenic sleep in deep
  space.</p>
<p>Marissa and I reflected on the party as we sat down to eat the first
  of many burgers in our backlog of party leftovers.  We&#8217;re so grateful
  for everyone in Rodney&#8217;s life.  Did you know that most people&#8217;s first
  memory is their third birthday party?  That&#8217;s true for me, my wife,
  and most people I ask.  If it&#8217;s true for Rodney, I can&#8217;t think of a
  better first memory.  Thanks for showing up and making the party
  awesome, friends, and possibly being part of his first human memory.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to a great birthday!  Time to binge watch stranger things.  And
  maybe break into some of that leftover cake.</p>
