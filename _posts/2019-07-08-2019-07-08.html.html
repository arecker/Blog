<p>Good Morning!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling refreshed today, and eager to get back to work.  I took a
  pretty long nap yesterday, which allowed us to stay up a bit and knock
  out some episodes of <i>Stranger Things</i>.  Speaking of Stranger Things,
  I couldn&#8217;t be happier watching season 3 right now.  I have some
  thoughts:</p>
<p>I love the contrast between how little the characters know about
  what&#8217;s going on with how much the viewer knows what&#8217;s going on,
  observing all the story lines.  You can stay a few steps ahead of
  all the characters and draw conclusions before they do, which
  creates a lot of dramatic irony and suspense.
  I love the <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> parallels.  Last night I noticed
  that if you pay attention to Will&#8217;s <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>
  campaigns, they usually describe what&#8217;s going on in the season,
  e.g. &#8220;the peaceful town is threatened by a dark force coming out of
  the swamp.&#8221;  I&#8217;m not that familiar with <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, but
  each of the characters in the show kind of plays out like a
  character with their own special skills.
  Winona Ryder is really good at playing a mom from Indiana who flips
  out over weird things happening to her appliances.  This is the
  only spoiler I&#8217;ll give, but magnets on her fridge are the new
  Christmas lights.</p>
<p>So yeah, I couldn&#8217;t be happier with this season.  Season 1 &amp; 2 were
  good, but I just wasn&#8217;t gaga over the show until now.</p>
<p>So what else is going on.  Ah, yesterday I hacked on my blog code a
  bit.  I added a generated <a href="https://www.alexrecker.com/feed.xml">feed.xml</a> file.  I set up an IFTTT service to
  post to my family&#8217;s slack channel whenever I added a new entry, and
  I&#8217;m also thinking about hooking it into twitter.  With another side
  project almost completely wrapped up, my head is filled with all kinds
  of fun ideas to work on.  I think next I might hack some more on
  &#8220;edgar&#8221;.  The idea is pretty out there, but &#8220;edgar&#8221; is a home
  automation assistant that you talk to with consoles around the house.
  At first he&#8217;ll have a very simple shell in which you can launch
  modules.  I came up with something like this last night.</p>
<pre class="example">
EDGAR&gt; groceries
Launching groceries module.
Available commands: add delete show exit
GROCERIES&gt; show
black garbage bags
gallon ziploc bags
sippies cups
GROCERIES&gt; add milk, eggs, butter
Added milk, eggs, butter
</pre>
<p>I have plenty of ideas for modules, but a grocery list would be a good
  one to start with.  If I get a chance to work on it tonight, I&#8217;ll be
  sure to bring back some updates.</p>
<p>Alright, time to get going.  Let&#8217;s have a wonderful day!</p>
