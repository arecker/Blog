<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  It was Rodney&#8217;s actual birthday, so
  I worked from home in the morning, then took the family out to Ian&#8217;s
  Pizza for lunch.  We walked around the square a bit, then Marissa and
  Rodney dropped me off at work and went to the zoo.  Apparently Rodney
  is really into the monkeys now, as well as yelling &#8220;WAKE UP&#8221; at all
  the animals that were sleeping.  When I got home from work, he showed
  me some new toys they opened together, then we crashed on the couch a
  bit and watched an episode of Blippi.  There&#8217;s a new Blippi episode
  out where he learns to skateboard with Shaun White, and like most
  Blippi episodes that over-feature a celebrity, the whole thing is very
  uncomfortable and I recommend you watch it.  After eating some dinner,
  we walked to the Biergarten and had a drink while Rod played in the
  sandbox.  Things got a little tense when another kid commandeered
  Rodney&#8217;s newly gifted skid steer we brought from home to test drive in
  the sandbox.  Emotions ran hot, but we settled on letting him take
  home one of Rodney&#8217;s plastic hard hats.  That seemed to smooth things
  over.</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, I had a bunch of chores to catch up on,
  and I had a time lapse to make for Marissa.  I still feel like I&#8217;m
  catching up on things after getting ready for the party.  The routine
  is settling back in, but I&#8217;m still not mentally back yet, and I&#8217;m
  having a hard time focusing on things.  The last thing we did before
  going to bed was watch three episodes of Stranger Things.  I know I
  was raving about how this season was the best, but it took a really
  weird turn.  I don&#8217;t think this counts as a spoiler, but the writers
  thought it would be a good idea to wedge a plot line into the middle
  of things that can only be described as a &#8220;kid-friendly Austin
  Powers&#8221;.  Let&#8217;s say this, how about a week from today, I call a
  &#8220;weapons free&#8221; on the Stranger Things spoilers and go into detail.
  Marissa and I spent at least a good half hour talking about it and I&#8217;m
  dying to share, so consider this your warning, reader.</p>
<p>So what else is going on&#8230; I&#8217;ve got work on my mind.  Next week, our
  summer interns are joining my team and I&#8217;m in charge of handing out
  work to them.  I set up all the tasks about a month and a half ago and
  was feeling pretty good about it, but after reviewing everything
  yesterday, it&#8217;s clear to me that it&#8217;s not enough to fill seven weeks.
  I&#8217;m hoping I can get some time today to focus on padding it - padding
  it with <i>meaningful</i> work, of course.</p>
<p>So today is Tuesday, and normally what I do on Tuesday night is find a
  new vegetarian recipe to enjoy with our good friends on Wednesday
  night at Madison&#8217;s concert on the square.  I haven&#8217;t made up my mind
  yet, so I was hoping to find a free twenty minutes to shop around for
  a recipe.  I&#8217;d love to do vegetarian buddha bowls, but honestly my
  sticky rice skills are pretty abysmal, and sticky rice is kind of the
  star of the show with that one.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pick a theme for this hot, sunny Tuesday.  I&#8217;m going to go with
  &#8220;back on track&#8221;.  I&#8217;m going to get to work, put some Frank Ocean on,
  and just crush it until lunch.  Maybe I&#8217;ll take a quick walk to grab a
  bite to eat, then I&#8217;ll sit somewhere and pick a recipe to cook
  tonight.  I&#8217;m all caught up on chores, so we&#8217;re good on that front,
  but after throwing a big party our kitchen could use some love, so I
  might go above and beyond tonight.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to Tuesday.  Hope we all get back on track today.</p>
