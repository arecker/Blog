<p>It&#8217;s been a wonderful weekend - so great that I&#8217;ve barely spent any
  time on the computer.  We all went to Kalahari water park on Saturday.
  We were all pretty excited - even Rodney had been talking about
  <i>waterslides</i> all week leading up to it.  So expectations were high.
  I started to get pumped for it myself.  We&#8217;d be watching a toddler,
  but maybe he would have so much fun that I&#8217;d get to do a few
  waterslides too.</p>
<p>Things started to get rough while we were checking in.  Rodney wasn&#8217;t
  a fan of the plastic bracelet he had to wear, and threw a modest,
  miniature tantrum in the lobby.  After regaining our composure and
  heading through the locker rooms, reality continued to set in.  I
  think Rodney expected waterslides, but not a busy water park with kids
  and parents running around.  So he was a little weireded out, and
  seemed hesitant to enjoy himself in front of everyone.  Marissa and I
  did our best to kind of ease him into it, which culminated into a
  coerced ride on the lazy river.  &#8220;Easy&#8221;, I thought - &#8220;we just kind of
  force him onto a tube and by the time the leisurely current carries us
  away, the child wonderment will take over and he&#8217;ll be cool with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was not cool with it.  My kid is not really a <i>shrieker</i> - the kind
  that can command a whole waterpark with just one scream - but he just
  visibly looked anxious and upset, and every now and then he would
  loudly announce &#8220;OK ALL DONE, OK ALL DONE, NO MORE PLEASE&#8221;.  Honestly,
  I&#8217;d rather be sitting in a tube with a screaming toddler that just
  wasn&#8217;t having it.  Somehow I felt even guiltier sitting with a
  patient, but anxious toddler trying to diplomatically negotiate his
  release from this weird punishment based on water and fear.</p>
<p>We dried off and decided to eat some lunch.  We needed some quiet time
  to regroup, and perhaps lower our expectations a bit.  We found a
  booth in the food court and opened the PB&amp;J&#8217;s, pringles, sliced bell
  peppers, and chocolate rice krispies I packed for us.  I&#8217;m aware
  you&#8217;re not supposed to bring your own food into Kalahari, but it&#8217;s a
  matter of principal.  I enjoy sticking it to these kinds of places in
  that way, but it also helps that nobody who works there actually
  cares.  Plus, I probably looked like I was just waiting for a fight.
  I wouldn&#8217;t have said something to me either.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re in the food court nibbling on food.  Rodney was enjoying the
  quiet time away from the crowd, and Marissa and I were lowering our
  expectations about how much fun we were going to squeeze out of these
  fifty dollar tickets.  &#8220;Maybe we just need to loosen up a bit,&#8221; I
  said.  &#8220;We should treat ourselves to a drink from the bar.&#8221;  It
  sounded like a good idea.  Rodney wasn&#8217;t really digging the pool, and
  people were walking around with these really big colorful alcoholic
  slurpee things.  We ordered two from the bartender while Rodney waited
  patiently by a little fountain.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll take two of those fruit
  things,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;The big one, right?&#8221; asked the bartender.  &#8220;Ugh,
  sure that&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bartender had our drinks ready in about four seconds.  It looked
  like a bucket of ice, a bunch of sugary syrup, and maybe a half shot
  of cheap vodka.  He turned to me and said &#8220;sixteen&#8221;, asking for my
  card.  I was relieved because the price for these silly drinks wasn&#8217;t
  posted anywhere, and I could barely hear the guy and was honestly
  expecting to pay ten bucks each.  But eight bucks was just barely
  acceptable.</p>
<p>He took my card and produced a receipt.  The total was <i>sixty</i>
  dollars.  The drinks were thirty bucks each.  We immediately flagged
  the guy down and asked for a refund.  He was reluctant, and really
  tried to sell us on them.  &#8220;You get to keep the cup&#8221;, he said.
  Marissa put her foot down - &#8220;we don&#8217;t want these and we want our money
  back.  We didn&#8217;t know how expensive they were, sorry.&#8221;  The bartender
  went to the register to revert the charge.  Marissa quickly grabbed
  the drink and took several sips before they were confiscated.</p>
<p>At this point, we were feeling pretty defeated, and just decided to
  wander a little further into the park.  We found a basketball hoop and
  a kiddie pool with about a foot of water.  Rodney really likes
  basketball, so he got pretty into it and started shooting hoops with
  some other kids.  Playing basketball got him excited about everything
  else, and all of the sudden he wanted to run into a little water
  jungle gym that had slides running out of it.  He did a few slides,
  gained his confidence, and eventually climbed to the very top of the
  jungle gym.  There were these really big slides coming out of the top.
  Rodney started saying &#8220;waterslide pleese&#8221;, and I was really surprised
  by that because we were about three floors up and the slides looked
  pretty big.  I wasn&#8217;t even sure if he was big enough.</p>
<p>We walked up to the lifeguard sitting at the top and I asked &#8220;is he
  big enough to ride these&#8221;.  The lifeguard nodded, then went back to
  staring off into space.  I guess we were good to go.  I made a quick
  plan with Marissa so she would meet me at the bottom.  Rodney sat down
  at the top of the slide, and I knelt down to prepare him for it.  I
  think I was more scared than he was, because half way into my
  briefing, he lunged forward and flung himself into the tube.  I felt a
  mix of worry, pride, and amusement watching his little body spin,
  bounce, and splash all the way to the bottom.  Marissa&#8217;s mouth was
  wide open when he hit the water - we were both in complete disbelief.</p>
<p>We went down every slide in the jungle gym.  We even started to take
  shifts so either Marissa or I could take a break and do a bigger
  slide.  My favorite was the <i>screaming hyena</i>.  You stand in a tube,
  and the floor drops, sending you into a completely vertical slide that
  doesn&#8217;t even touch your body until halfway down.  I talked Marissa
  into trying it (without telling her what to expect of course), and
  Rodney and I waited for her at the bottom.</p>
<p>So Kalahari was a success after all.  Things were looking pretty
  dismal, hitting a lowpoint when we were almost conned into spending
  $60 on a slurpee.  But the timeless magic of waterslides were there
  all along, and not even my son could resist.  Waterslides were also a
  real lesson in letting go.  I don&#8217;t think of myself as a helicopter
  parent, which is why I didn&#8217;t expect to feel fear as my son was
  climbing into a giant yellow water slide.</p>
<p>When we got home, Marissa and Rodney slept.  I walked to the grocery
  store and picked up steaks, potatoes, and corn on the cob.  I slowly
  roasted the potatoes on the grill, seared the steaks, then while
  everything rested I blistered the corn.  It was a good day.</p>
