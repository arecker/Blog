<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Last weekend was great.  It was filled with good food, good family
  time, and a lot of relaxation.  Kalahari was a success, and I really
  enjoyed grilling this weekend.  Oh, and I even got some time to code
  yesterday while Rodney took a nap.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I got some good relaxation time in, because frankly this week
  at work is going to be a crazy.  Today, the summer interns are joining
  our team, and I&#8217;m handing out work to them.  I&#8217;m also on ticket duty
  this week, which means I&#8217;ll be fielding questions in our team&#8217;s slack
  channel during the day and on call in the evenings - which isn&#8217;t
  terrible, it&#8217;s just a different kind of work.  It&#8217;s also goals week,
  which means I&#8217;m drafting up my professional goals for the last half of
  the year and working to get them approved.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a lot going on.  I was anticipating the craziness, and I&#8217;m
  actually fine with it.  I like having busy weeks like this every now
  and then, because it just makes the weekend that much more awesome.
  Plus, the momentum of a busy work week usually makes its way into
  chores and side projects - as long as I&#8217;m hustling at work, I may as
  well hustle at home.</p>
<p>Ugh.  Here&#8217;s a free tip - never eat hot sauce before bed.  Last night,
  Marissa and I stayed up watching <i>Hot Ones</i>, and I got all excited
  about hot sauce and decided to eat a big glob of &#8220;The Last Dab&#8221; on a
  cracker.  I woke up this morning feeling like there was a car battery
  sitting in my stomach.  You know what the scary thing is?  I think
  some hot sauces get even meaner as they continue to sit on the shelf.
  I don&#8217;t remember that one being so feisty - especially after it makes
  it to the stomach.  Why do I do these things?</p>
<p>So where was I - ah, the busy work week.  To sum up, bring it on.
  I&#8217;ve got good music to listen to, good coffee to drink, and I just
  rewrote my Emacs configs over the weekend for peak efficiency.</p>
<p>OK, let&#8217;s do this!  Let&#8217;s have a productive week.</p>
