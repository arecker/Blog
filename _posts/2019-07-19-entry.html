<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>We made it to Friday!  It&#8217;s been a pretty crazy week filled with
  ticket duty, working with interns, cooking, video editing, chores,
  journaling, and over-sleeping, but we&#8217;ve finally arrived at Friday and
  are at the precipice of a long, relaxing weekend.  Tonight, Marissa,
  Rodney, and I are going to see the new lion king.  Not going to lie to
  you, our collective expectations are low.  Marissa, being the biggest
  lion king fan between the three of us, is worried her expectations are
  not going to be met, especially hearing about the CGI, and all the
  changes they made to the set list and the lyrics, etc.  Me and
  Rodney&#8217;s expectations are a little lower - as long as we see at least
  a few lions and get to eat a big bucket of popcorn, we&#8217;ll have a good
  time.</p>
<p>I feel like I&#8217;m one of the few children that doesn&#8217;t have a special
  emotional connection to the Lion King.  I swear to you, I don&#8217;t think
  I sat down and watched the movie beginning to end until I was in my
  twenties.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong - I knew all about it.  I used to play
  the video game on the SEGA genesis, but I hated it.  The game was
  sadistically difficult.  Even the first level where you play as a
  young Simba, rolling and frolicking around pride rock, dodging beetles
  and trying to climb rocks, was way too difficult.  Maybe watching baby
  simba fall off a ledge and die, or step on a beatle one too many times
  and die, or (if you&#8217;re lucky) just get mauled to death by the hyena at
  the very end of the level has left be desensitized.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, I&#8217;m along for the ride tonight.  I&#8217;m less upset about
  this specific remake as I am about all of them in general.  Think
  about it.  It seems like Disney is really on track to literally re
  release a CGI version of every movie they have ever made.  Sure,
  they&#8217;re starting with the easy ones first.  The Lion King.  Aladdin.
  The little mermaid.  Those tales are chock full of empowering
  messages.  But I&#8217;m waiting for them to finally get around to vamping
  something like <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>.  How do you get young girls excited
  about a beautiful young princess that sleeps in a tube and waits for a
  magic kiss from a prince?  How about when she gets conned into washing
  dishes for all those dwarfs in the woods?  And then I think there&#8217;s a
  poisonous fruit in the mix somewhere?</p>
<p>I think I was trying to build up to something, but I might just be
  demonstrating how little I know about these Disney movies.  I don&#8217;t
  think there are any dwarfs in sleeping beauty, are there?  Man, if
  that&#8217;s the case, then what else happens in sleeping beauty?</p>
<p>If disney movies are your thing, then I hope for your sake that the
  Lion King remake is everything you hoped it would be.  And if it&#8217;s
  not, then I hope you let &#8216;em have it.</p>
<p>I was talking to a friend who had a very interesting interpretation of
  this whole Disney movie remake stasis we&#8217;re trapped in.  &#8220;Millenials
  are the <i>me</i> generation, so they&#8217;re only showing their kids things
  that THEY were into as kids.&#8221;  That&#8217;s a very poignant observation,
  isn&#8217;t it?  I had just assumed producers were lazy, or they didn&#8217;t
  want to pass up on an established franchise only to stick their neck
  out for one that nobody&#8217;s ever heard of.  But maybe we&#8217;re the problem.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your favorite movie?  How would you feel about a remake?  Are
  some things better left in the past?  Good questions to chew on this
  rainy Friday morning.  Have a wonderful day, everyone.  Watch out for
  beetles, hyenas, and falling rocks.</p>
