<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Happy Saturday!  Yesterday, Marissa, Rodney, and I saw the new Lion
  King movie, and I&#8217;m pleased to report it was pretty good.  As I&#8217;ve
  covered before, I&#8217;m not especially invested in Disney movies, so the
  real test is what Marissa and Rodney thought of it - and they loved
  it.  I don&#8217;t know - I guess I was expecting them to mess with the
  movie a bit more.  They threw in a few new jokes (the Beauty and the
  Beast reference was hilarious and totally unexpected), but it was
  clear that Disney knew how important this movie was to people and
  didn&#8217;t take any risks with it.</p>
<p>When we got home, Rodney immediately fell asleep as the popcorn coma
  was starting to set in, and we had a pretty low key evening.  Marissa
  painted, I caught up on chores, then we reconvened at 11 to play Nazi
  Zombies.  For the uninitiated, <i>Nazi Zombies</i> is a mini game in the
  <i>Call of Duty</i> where you and a buddy cooperatively fight off hoards of
  Nazi Zombies.  There&#8217;s a bit of strategy involved in defending the
  windows of the house and gaining points to spend on a random weapon
  dispenser.  But the game has become a real staple in our married home
  life.  We talk about the day, plan things, and reflect on life - all
  over the dulcet sounds of gunfire and gnashing zombie teeth.</p>
<p>This morning, we just got done eating breakfast.  We had some
  scrambled eggs on toast.  Later this morning after I shower, I&#8217;m going
  to take Rodney to the market and pick up stuff to make <i>paposa</i>.  It&#8217;s
  essentially chuck roast rubbed in garlic and pepper corns and braised
  in red wine all day.  Really, it takes all day to make, so if I get it
  on the stove around 12:30, that&#8217;s actually cutting it pretty close.
  The upside is your house smells like - well - chuck roast braised in
  red wine all day.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful weekend.  Relax, unwind, and cook
  something that you would only have time for on a hot, lazy Saturday
  like today.</p>
