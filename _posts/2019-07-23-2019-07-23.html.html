<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>In seventh grade I saved up my money and bought a Palm Zire.  I was
  really excited about this upgrade, because it would be the first Palm
  Pilot I had with a color screen and support for viewing pictures.  You
  could load your personal files on an SD card and insert the card into
  the device, and the coolest part about this was that you could even
  use your own picture as a custom background image.  The Palm Zire was
  everything I hoped it would be - the battery lasted long, writing with
  the stylus was snappy and responsive, and the enormous 12 square
  inches of screen seemed like almost too much rel estate.</p>
<p>A few of my other friends at school also had Palm Pilots, and before
  school we would pass around each other&#8217;s SD cards and trade games and
  apps.  I always felt a little guilty about it, because I had assumed
  it was technically stealing, and that even though copying the app to a
  friends device happened to work, if you wanted an authentic copy you
  had to buy a CD-ROM, install it on your desktop at home, then sync it
  over to your palm pilot while it was docked (that was a very
  gratifying ritual as well - you would press a big glowing green button
  and the &#8220;HotSync&#8221; process would cause your device and computer to
  display a loading par simultaneously).</p>
<p>My friend gave me an application called &#8220;Yesterday&#8221;.  It&#8217;s icon had a
  little apple and steno pad.  It was a to-do list program made
  specifically with students.  Not only could you quickly add tasks to a
  queue, but you could group them by class and even create a list of
  books you would need to bring home that night.  The benefits of this
  app were self evident after only a few days of use.  It actually made
  me excited about getting work done.  It was gratifying tap the
  completed items with the stylus and watch a thin back line run through
  the middle of the text, and when you were all finished with your work,
  it would display a icon of a beach, implying that it was really time
  to relax now that your work is completed.</p>
<p>But the more I used this app, the guiltier I felt.  For how much
  mileage I was getting out of this nifty little application, I felt a
  little bad that I wasn&#8217;t running an authentic copy.  One day, I got
  curious and started poking around the menus, and I found the README.
  &#8220;YESTERDAY is shareware&#8221;, it said.  That was the first time I had ever
  seen that term.  &#8220;You may buy a copy, but please share this program
  with as many friends as possible.&#8221;  My guilt immediately vanished.
  Was it really that simple?  I didn&#8217;t realize that someone could
  intentionally give their program away like that.</p>
<p>That was the first time it really clicked for me.  I had always
  admired people that can tastefully automate something, and I was
  really inspired by the generosity of forgoing clunky activation tokens
  and tacky &#8220;trial expired&#8221; error pop-ups for the sake of just helping
  as many people as possible.  To write a program that helps people,
  then to just give it away for free - what a wonderful thing to do for
  the people around you.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a trick in software, and it&#8217;s counter intuitive.  You
  would think that the more expensive something is, the better it is,
  right?  Well in software, it&#8217;s usually the opposite.  You want to use
  as many free programs as possible, because free programs are written
  by people that were just trying to solve a problem, then had the
  meekness and generosity to just give it away.  Perhaps free software
  is better because the author is more focused on the problem than
  making a quick buck.  The Yesterday program felt like it was written
  by a real student who was fed up trying to find the right program that
  fit a student&#8217;s work load.  Maybe it&#8217;s better because people that are
  thrifty with their wallet are more resourceful with what computer
  resources their program uses.  You know what I really think it is?  At
  the end of the day, I think generous people just have good taste.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your favorite computer program?  Did you pay for it, or was it
  free?</p>
