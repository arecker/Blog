<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful day today!  Lately, Wednesdays are my very busy days,
  but the nice weather and the smell of good coffee is talking me into
  it.  Today I&#8217;m drinking this new blend of coffee I grabbed from the
  Jenny Street market called &#8220;smart ass&#8221;.  The label had a little
  picture of a donkey wearing thick glasses, and that was the only sales
  pitch I needed.  And it&#8217;s delicious!  So really not a bad choice in
  the end.  You&#8217;d be surprised at how many of my buying choices are
  totally based on something silly, like whether or not the label makes
  me laugh.  And you&#8217;d be even more surprised at how often that strategy
  works out.  Like when it comes to craft beer, you gotta go with a
  label &amp; name that&#8217;s confident, but not pretentious.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m being kind of facetious, but there&#8217;s probably some truth to that.
  How things are labeled and named are a reflection of a creator&#8217;s
  personality, aren&#8217;t they?  If you pick out a beer with a muted, thin
  cursive letters, bearing an aloof name like <i>Wensleton Pale Ale</i>
  (that&#8217;s not a real beer, I just made it up), chances are the brewers
  think very highly of themselves and the beer is not as good as they
  think it is.</p>
<p>3 Floyd&#8217;s beer makes me think of rock and roll.  The brews have quasi
  violent names, and the bottles are decked out with intense death metal
  imagery, and the regalia is fitting.  In the past few years, they&#8217;ve
  kind of become true brewing rock stars of the Midwest.  There&#8217;s a lot
  of beer competition in Wisconsin, let alone Madison, and very few out
  of state beers seem to make it into my liquor store.  The fact that 3
  Floyd&#8217;s has two shelves all on their own in a Madison liquor store
  speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Me and Marissa&#8217;s daily driver is Fantasy Factory, which is known for
  its utterly ridiculous label.  It&#8217;s a cat, holding a golden pistol
  wearing some ninja garb riding on a unicorn.  And truth be told, I
  never studied the picture in detail, but I think there&#8217;s a light saber
  and some ninja stars represented as well.  But the label is as
  ridiculous as it is magnificent.  I think the ridiculous
  ninja-cat-on-a-unicorn strikes a chord with people who would rather
  live without shame.  The brewery that makes Fantasy Factory can be a
  little over the top at times, but they can afford to experiment and be
  a little outlandish because their hometown loves them so much and
  they&#8217;re not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Sometimes labels can be misleading.  I keep buying the wrong
  toothpaste at Hy-Vee.  Toothpaste brands look way too similar, so I
  end up just grabbing the first blue box that makes me think &#8220;yeah, I
  think I&#8217;ve seen you hanging around in our bathroom cabinet before&#8221;.
  And the imagery of wintergreen rapids and frosty winds lull you into
  an assurance that even if you didn&#8217;t pick the brand you normally get,
  your mouth is still going to feel clean and refreshed.  But you made a
  mistake, and the toothpaste that&#8217;s supposed to be blue comes out white
  with a gross little red stripe and the taste vaguely resembles
  playdough sweetened with splenda, and now you have a whole month to
  look forward to of putting up with this utter stranger in your morning
  routine.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish certain things didn&#8217;t have labels.  Have you ever
  peeled the label off of the containers in your fridge?  Sometimes I
  transfer things like cheese, lemon juice, or salsa to clear bags or
  Tupperware.  I like being able to glance at something and quickly see
  how much is left.  I like reaching for a bottle that&#8217;s bright green,
  and undeniably filled with lime juice because what else would be in
  it?  I don&#8217;t need a weird picture of a farmer&#8217;s head or solemn organic
  lime farming regalia to show me where the lime juice is.</p>
<p>Labels get a little noisy sometimes.  It feels like you can flip over
  every bag or bottle and read things like &#8220;YOU CHOSE NEWMAN&#8217;S RANCH -
  do you know what that says about you?&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;re cool, calm and
  collected, aren&#8217;t you?  We can tell, because you chose to enjoy
  David&#8217;s Sunflower Seeds&#8221;.  Label your product.  Put some humor and
  pride in it.  But don&#8217;t try to reach into my private life and project
  your weird corporate delusions onto me.  I&#8217;m just a guy, I&#8217;m not a
  <i>Newman&#8217;s ranch dressing</i> guy.</p>
<p>Well, time to start the day.  We <i>Newman&#8217;s ranch dressing guys</i> are
  relentlessly punctual.  Go rip the label off of something.</p>
