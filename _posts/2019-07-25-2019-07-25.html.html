<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty action-packed day.  I had my usual set of
  meetings in the morning, but in the afternoon we discovered that the
  thing the interns were building needed access an LDAP server.  We were
  already at a threshold of maximum rules defined around the LDAP
  server, so I spend most of the day tracking down rules that could be
  removed to free up space.  It was a classic <i>yak-shaving</i> day.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with the term <i>yak-shaving</i>, it&#8217;s worth
  knowing.  The back story is a little embellished, depending on the
  version you hear, but in summary, a guy asks his neighbor for a cup of
  sugar, and the neighbor asks him to first retrieve something of his
  from the other neighbor, who in turn asks him to first retrieve
  something os his from a different neighbor, and on it goes until, the
  guy finds himself doing various chores - including shaving somebody&#8217;s
  yaks - all because he just wanted a cup of sugar.  Do you have days
  where you set out to do something simple and plausible, but ended up
  fixing a whole chain of things to get there?</p>
<p>Once all the yak-shaving was done, I met Marissa and Rodney at a taco
  place to grab dinner before the concert on the square.  Tacos were a
  good choice - did you know yesterday was national tequila day?  The
  restaurant was celebrating with lots of free Margarita samples, and
  Rodney even got a free luchador mask.  What would a toddler need with
  a luchador mask?  Who knows, but he was quite smitten with it and I&#8217;m
  sure it will be making unexpected appearances all weekend.</p>
<p>After dinner, we mozied over to our spot on the capital lawn and
  listened to the concert.  Last night&#8217;s theme was <i>The Beatles</i>, and
  our friends had a lot of fun teasing us for how few Beatles songs we
  recognized.  I remember things about the Beatles the same way I might
  remember things about US presidents or street names in a new town.
  The vague familiarity is there, but hearing <i>Hey Jude</i> isn&#8217;t going to
  send me back in time on a wave of nostalgia.  There are a few DC talk
  songs that could do that to me, but nothing by the Beatles
  unfortunately.</p>
<p>We got home from the concert on the square pretty late, some time
  around 9:30, then I got started on chores.  Wednesdays are a pretty
  chore heavy day for me, and that&#8217;s by design.  I like being a little
  busy on Wednesday night and using the momentum to get over the week&#8217;s
  hump.  I had to catch up on dishes, then I cleaned and wiped down the
  microwave &amp; stove, and finally cleaned out the fridge.  Sometimes I
  like to snack on food that&#8217;s nearing the expiration date in an effort
  to free up more space, but the chimichanga and free Margaritas kicking
  around in my stomach weren&#8217;t in the mood for company.</p>
<p>I wrapped up chores around 11:30 - just in time to watch an episode of
  <i>New Girl</i>.  Marissa and I started over from season 1, and it&#8217;s a
  great way to end the day.  I also sipped on a half shot of tequila - I
  had 30 minutes remaining in National Tequila day, and it only comes
  once a year, right?</p>
<p>Today should be another ringer of a day.  I&#8217;m working from home in the
  morning, then I&#8217;m taking Rodney into the office for Bring Your Kid to
  Work Day.  We&#8217;re taking the bus in, then we&#8217;re going to play it by
  ear.  My work has a lot of planned activities for the kids, but we
  might also just hang out in a conference room and color while I get
  some work done.</p>
<p>So another action packed day ahead.  But it&#8217;s Thursday, and before you
  know it, it&#8217;ll be Friday and we&#8217;ll have a relaxing weekend ahead of
  us.  We might just have to shave a few yaks to get there.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a Thursday!</p>
