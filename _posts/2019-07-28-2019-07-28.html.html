<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday was a wonderful day.  We took our time drinking coffee and
  nibbling on breakfast before we head out on the boat around lunch
  time.  Once we got out onto the lake, we realized the tube wasn&#8217;t
  inflated correctly and we had to double back - but we all didn&#8217;t mind
  the boat ride and the warm sun.  After we docked, Marissa and her mom
  headed up to the camper to restock the cooler, and Tom took the tube
  pump to a nearby outlet, leaving me and Rodney in the boat.  It was
  fun to watch Rodney putz around the boat.  He spent some time sitting
  in the passenger seat, he leaned over the edge looking for <i>baby
  sharks</i> (I may have told him that was a possibility).</p>
<p>When everyone returned, we once again headed out on the lake and got
  some tubing time in.  Rodney, Renee, and Marissa were the first to go.
  Rodney was unsure about the whole thing, but he was a good sport.
  Marissa and I went for a while.  It&#8217;s funny how soar you can get just
  laying on a tube getting pulled behind a boat.  How is that even a
  workout?  Why do my joints hurt so bad right now?</p>
<p>We anchored the boat by some shallow water.  Marissa agreed to watch
  Rodney while I closed my eyes at the front of the boat under a beach
  towel.  Falling asleep on a boat gently tossing in the water might be
  one of the greatest kinds of naps on earth.  While I slept, I thought
  about the story where Jesus slept on a boat during a thunderstorm
  while the apostles thought they were going to die.  I woke up feeling
  refreshed, and to my surprise Rodney was sleeping too.  He takes a nap
  every day in the afternoon, and old habits die hard - even on a boat.</p>
<p>We went out to dinner at a pizza place from Marissa&#8217;s childhood.  I
  got a free beer that they poured by mistake.  After dinner, Marissa
  and I went for a quick walk around the campsite before deciding to
  turn in for the night.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re going to play a few rounds of bingo before making the
  drive home.  I&#8217;ll spend the whole drive thinking about what to make
  for dinner when we get home.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a Sunday!  Take a nap on a boat if you can, I really
  recommend it.</p>
