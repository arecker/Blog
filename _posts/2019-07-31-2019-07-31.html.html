<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>So Chance the Rapper released a new album last Friday.  While we were
  packing from Hayward, I was refreshing my phone in hopes I&#8217;d have
  enough time to download it for the car.  I saw the new twitter post
  minutes before we started up the car.  We tried listening to it on
  Spotify and got a few tracks in, but the free tier only lets you
  shuffle albums.  We managed to listen to the first track on YouTube.
  I get psyched hearing <i>and we back</i> at the beginning of each of his
  albums, but the rest of it just sounded like a terrible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpkf_p71rKY">Bill Wurtz</a>
  song.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have time to listen to more of the album over the weekend
  until Sunday.  Rodney was eating breakfast, and Renee and Tom were
  driving to town to pick up some stuff for the boat.  I clicked through
  several more songs.  There were some pretty moments sprinkled
  throughout, but I started to wonder if it was a bad album.</p>
<p>After we got home, catching up on chores gave me an opportunity to
  finally dig in. I was eager to find at least one track to put on my
  end of the year hip-hop mix tape, but I honestly couldn&#8217;t find any.
  My excitement for a new Chance album turned into morbid curiosity as
  to how this mess of a project would be received.  The reddit comments
  and tweets were split - some insisting the album was really bad, and
  other insisting that <i>Coloring Book</i> got the same flack when it first
  came out.  Some reviews trickled in over the weekend, but last night
  my favorite music critic Anthony Fantano finally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjriHA-MLPg">released his review.</a>
  In short, he didn&#8217;t like it either.  He <i>really</i> didn&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>That got me thinking about how I found Chance.  I was late in the
  game - the first single I heard that really stuck with me was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eedeXTWZUn8">Angels.</a>
  I loved how bright and cocky the rapping was, and his whole sound just
  oozed with this attractive Chicago pride.  I&#8217;ve only been living in
  Madison for about four years, and I still feel a bit like an outsider.
  It felt good to connect with my home city (and don&#8217;t even start with
  that whole <i>the suburbs don&#8217;t count</i> spiel, the way I see it if you
  can ride the train into the city, you live in the city).</p>
<p>I worked backwards into Chance&#8217;s discography from there.  The track
  <i>angels</i> was a single that would likely be on his next album, but I
  still had plenty to explore.  <i>Acid Rap</i> became my new regular listen
  on the hour long bus ride from Middleton to the east side.  I had
  barely gotten time to listen to his first album <i>10 Day</i> before
  <i>Coloring Book</i> was released.  It was very different from his last
  projects.  He had just had a kid, and some real sentimentality started
  to permeate.  I think that may have been the first time I heard the
  term <i>dad rap</i>, and perfect timing because I had just become a Dad a
  few weeks earlier.  Actually, I played the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yZnkwzeFfE">Grown Ass Kids</a> in the
  delivery room just moments after Rodney was born, which was a leaked
  track that never made it onto coloring book because of licensing
  issues.  Marissa and I really liked the song, because we felt wildly
  unprepared to have a kid.  We were still figuring out how to pay bills
  and keep our house from falling apart, and we still just felt like
  kids.</p>
<p>My time&#8217;s almost up this morning, but in short, I loved coloring
  book.  Which is why <i>The Big Day</i> was such a shock.  It was such a
  change in velocity for Chance.  It&#8217;s been three years since his last
  project (Rodney&#8217;s age is a good way to measure when Coloring Book came
  out, isn&#8217;t it), and this direction is absolutely baffling.</p>
<p>I think I have more to say about Chance, but we&#8217;ll have to save it for
  another day.  If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to listen to it, check it
  out and join the conversation.  Hope you all have a wonderful
  Wednesday.</p>
