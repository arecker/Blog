<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>We made it to Friday!  It&#8217;s a beautiful morning, isn&#8217;t it?  I kicked
  off my morning routine with a slight variation today.  Usually I run a
  load of dishes, then before I turn in for the night I make coffee for
  the morning.  Last night, I had just finished making tonight&#8217;s pizza
  sauce, and the dishwasher was still running.  So this morning, instead
  of letting the coffee machine kick in and lazily browsing reddit in
  bed, I had to spring up and start the machine myself.  I watched an
  episode of Seinfeld while I waited - the one where George gets a
  massage from a man and feels uncomfortable about it.  George and Jerry
  discuss how to truly test if you&#8217;re a homosexual, and the rest of the
  episode George gets hostile when people unwittingly remind him of his
  new found insecurity - like when Jerry&#8217;s dentist friend tries to get
  George to join him in admiring an oiled, glistening Evander Holyfield
  on his poster.  <i>He&#8217;s a good fighter and a nice guy, but I don&#8217;t LIKE
  him.</i> The undeniable fact that this episode is still funny is a
  testament to the mastery of Seinfeld.  The conversation around
  sexuality has moved so far past the whole <i>hetero guy anxiously
  wonders if he&#8217;s gay</i> trope, it would have to take a genius to land
  that joke in 2019.  And there I was, laughing to it at 6:30 AM
  in 2019.</p>
<p>Today, Marissa, Rodney, and the puppies are going to an agility trial.
  It&#8217;s Ziggy&#8217;s first official trial in a while, and she&#8217;s been
  diligently practicing.  After work, I&#8217;ll arrive at an empty house,
  with nothing on my TODO list but making a pizza before everyone gets
  home.  I finished the sauce last night, but I&#8217;ll need to walk to the
  grocery store and pick up some cheese.  Hy-Vee struck out again last
  night, as they were out of pecorino cheese for the fourth week in a
  row.  They just reorganized their cheese aisle, and I&#8217;m starting to
  wonder if they just stopped carrying certain things all together.</p>
<p>This weekend, there&#8217;s more agility, but Rodney and I will be staying
  home.  He&#8217;s started to form food preferences.  The other day, Marissa
  tells me he asked to eat eggs for breakfast.  This weekend I&#8217;m on a
  quest to find out what else he likes to eat, and all through out we&#8217;ll
  be watching spider-man cartoons.  We&#8217;ve depleted our meager stash of
  2000&#8217;s era <i>Spectacular Spider-Man</i> episodes, so we&#8217;re turning the
  clock all the way back to 1994 and trying out the original 90&#8217;s
  version.  And don&#8217;t you accuse me of letting my own nostalgia dictate
  my son&#8217;s preferences - I barely had to try, and the 90&#8217;s Spider-Man is
  nothing short of a masterpiece.  Except the theme song - the theme
  song is absolutely garbage.  What do kids want to hear on Saturday
  morning?  Unsingable monotone grunge rock, of course.</p>
<p>Have a happy Friday everyone.  Today, let&#8217;s get our work done, then
  reward our effort with some good TV time.  Watch something a little
  older, maybe?</p>
