<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Happy Monday!  Fun fact - this is actually the second journal entry
  I&#8217;ve written this morning.  I&#8217;ve spent the last 23 minutes writing,
  then while thinking about what to write and fiddling with my power
  cord, I accidentally rebooted my computer without saving anything.
  Not to worry, I&#8217;ll just have to bring you back up to speed with the 7
  minute version.  To sum up, my phone woke me up last night at 4:30
  with what I thought was a work page, but just turned out to be a
  Linked In notification.  I also found a new cooking YouTube channel
  that is 80% solid advice and 20% blog spam that is still worth making
  fun of.  The example I cited was their 4 minute video on &#8220;bringing
  your caprese salad to the next level&#8221; which could have just been
  summarized with &#8220;use expensive ingredients&#8221;.  There - I think I&#8217;m
  caught up.</p>
<p>This week should be pretty busy.  I&#8217;m on ticket duty, and after
  absolutely crushing it last week our interns are running out of work.
  So I have to do a bit of a scramble to keep them busy.  This Friday is
  a work picnic, and this weekend the Rod man and I are holding it down
  on our own while Marissa is at my sister&#8217;s bridal shower.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful Monday morning.  To conclude this
  brief post, I offer some parting advice: save your work before you
  touch your power cable.</p>
