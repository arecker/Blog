excerpt: morning, stirfry, projects, and gravy

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, and happy Tuesday!  This morning I jumped out of bed
  much sooner than I usually do and enjoyed some YouTube while I waited
  for the coffee to finish brewing.  I&#8217;m seriously considering making it
  a personal installment in my morning routine.  Plus, I&#8217;m feeling much
  more coherent than I&#8217;d normally be just rolling out of bed and
  starting a journal entry.</p>
<p>Yesterday it felt pretty good to get back to work, but it was a really
  busy day filled with planning and meetings.  Lately I&#8217;ve just kind of
  accepted that on Mondays, I don&#8217;t have much time at my desk.  I might
  have a free half hour or hour, so once I sit down I try to make a
  checklist of things I want to get done in that work session and then
  crank &#8216;em out.</p>
<p>After work, I took Rodney to the grocery store to pick up stuff to
  make stir fry.  When I got home, he and Marissa were snuggling on the
  couch under a blanket, and he didn&#8217;t want to leave.  &#8220;No Hy-Vee.
  Cozy,&#8221; he said.  But as he heard me putting my shoes on and heading
  out the door, he changed his mind and ran over to the kitchen to join
  me.</p>
<p>When we got home, I made shrimp stir-fry with some vegetables.  I
  still have a serious phobia with making rice, so I leaned on my good
  friend Uncle Ben.  The stir fry turned out good, but not great.  I was
  really shy with the sauce.  I used to have a problem of adding too
  much sauce and too many vegetables, making it wet and difficult to
  heat up, and it appears I&#8217;ve over-corrected.</p>
<p>After Rodney went to bed, I wrapped up another leg of the file server
  project.  I got it to the point where I was ready to run the plex
  server back on.  It&#8217;s good to have plex back.  To celebrate (and kick
  the tires on the new setup), I watched <i>I Think You Should Leave</i> on
  shuffle while I cleaned things up.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m eager to finally decommission the old server.  I&#8217;ll
  re-purpose the remaining final two hard drives as redundancy, then
  start brainstorming for how I&#8217;d like to put to work the two raspberry
  pi&#8217;s I&#8217;ve freed up.  I&#8217;ve had the hankering to play some old video
  games, so there are good chances that a retropie will be involved.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also eager to try out classic, traditional gravy.  I found a good
  video and studied up, and I&#8217;m confident that I can get it working.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Tuesday today.  You can be sure I will
  report back my gravy and file server success.</p>
