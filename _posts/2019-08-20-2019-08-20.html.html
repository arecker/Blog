<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  I had a pretty productive day yesterday.  I
  only had a few meetings in the morning, so in the afternoon I made a
  list of things I had to do and went through them, one-by-one.  It felt
  good to catch up on things, and when I got home, the momentum
  continued.  Marissa and I sat down and synced up the calendar for the
  next few weeks.  For one, I had the date for the reunion wrong.  It
  turns out I have and extra week to work on things.  And the upcoming
  weekends don&#8217;t look so bad.</p>
<p>After going over our calendar, I put some more work into the dining
  room computer, adding velcro ties to cables.  If you have some cable
  issues of your own and you&#8217;re still living in the dark days of zip
  ties, duct tape, or just &#8220;wild style&#8221;, I couldn&#8217;t recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Brand-Reusable-Fastening-Organizing/dp/B001E1Y5O6">these
  velcro wraps</a> more.  They hold just as tightly as tape, but come off
  really easily and they&#8217;re reusable.</p>
<p>After tidying up the computer, I got some well-earned Minecraft time
  in.  I&#8217;m currently making a bridge from my little platform to the
  shore, building it right against the water.  Still trying to keep
  things practical, and it&#8217;s working out.  I think this may be one of my
  favorite spots I&#8217;ve ever picked.  I&#8217;m way out on the ocean on this
  little island.  Building on water always works out well because it&#8217;s
  easy to grow crops, and there are way less monsters to deal with.</p>
<p>For dinner (real dinner, not Minecraft), I made fried fish.  I think
  I&#8217;ve really honed my batter recipe.  The secret is to make it very
  watery.  It&#8217;s tempting to stir in more flour and make it velvety and
  appetizing, but you have to stop a little sooner when it&#8217;s just a
  little thicker than cream.  I also cut the fish into really small
  pieces - little strips that cooked in the oil in about forty seconds.
  It was a great batch, and I was happy with it.</p>
<p>Today will be more of the same.  Still finishing up intern work.
  We&#8217;re writing a blog post about our project now, which involves
  compiling all the trial data, making diagrams, and lots of writing.
  So this week feels like a victory lap with lots of editing.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day today.  Happy Tuesday, everyone.</p>
