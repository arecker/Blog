<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday was a bit of a rough one.  I had a pretty busy day at work,
  bouncing from one thing to another, and I didn&#8217;t get any writing
  done.  I still have today and tomorrow to finish the intern blog, but
  the way I see it, most of it probably has to get done this afternoon,
  so coming down to the wire.</p>
<p>After work, I took Rod to Hy-Vee and we picked up some burgers.
  Marissa was in the mood for something easy, so I just grabbed some
  pre-made burger patties and buns.  After starting the grill and
  cutting up the toppings, we all hung out outside to enjoy the charcoal
  smell.  Somehow, I pulled the burgers off the grill just a bit early,
  and I had already gone on to add the toppings, so I couldn&#8217;t throw
  them back on.  Luckily none of us got really sick, but the meal didn&#8217;t
  sit right in my stomach, and I could tell that Rod wasn&#8217;t sleeping
  well.  I stuck his burger in the microwave for a whole minute to
  finish cooking it, but maybe it was the grease or something.</p>
<p>Messing up dinner is a crummy feeling, isn&#8217;t it?  For how happy it can
  make you feel watching people get up from the table for seconds or
  wolf down leftovers late at night, there&#8217;s an equal and opposite
  reaction when your food makes people sick.</p>
<p>I spent about an hour cleaning up the kitchen.  On Tuesday&#8217;s I move
  everything off the counter tops and Windex everything, then I sweep
  the floor.  It was also knife sharpening day.  Once a month, I sharpen
  our six nicest knives with a whetstone.  I run them through the
  dishwasher again to make sure there are no metal filings around, then
  rub the wood cutting board down with mineral oil.</p>
<p>It felt good to sort of lose myself in kitchen chores yesterday.  I
  liked having time to think and collect myself after a busy day and a
  botched dinner.  After chores, I sat on the couch with Marissa and
  watched some TV.  I perused my usual YouTube channels to stock up on
  recipe ideas.  After tonight&#8217;s burger mishap, I could use a good
  comeback.  Later in the evening, Marissa got up to heat up some
  leftover fried fish from yesterday, so I got to have that warm feeling
  after all.</p>
<p>Today is a busy morning.  On Wednesdays I meet with each of the
  interns for some 1-on-1 time, asking them about their week, getting
  feedback, or just chit-chatting.  Those 1-on-1s lead right into a
  farewell intern lunch.  After lunch, I&#8217;m probably going to hide out in
  a quiet room and knock out some writing.</p>
<p>While sipping coffee just now, I got to staring at our computer
  wallpaper.  I set up a little program on our dining room computer that
  randomly changes the wallpaper every fifteen minutes, sourcing the
  choices from a folder that I filled up with random pictures.  Marissa
  even added a bunch yesterday too.  Right now it&#8217;s set to a picture I
  took off the back porch of the place we stayed at in Vancouver.  We
  have a few pics from up right against the railing, but this one is
  just a shot from my chair by the sliding glass door, and all you can
  see is my knees in front of a few feet of concrete.  You can still see
  the beautiful city, but it&#8217;s behind the railing, which runs up the
  rest of the picture.  Marissa and I were too spooked to hang out right
  up against the waist high metal railing - it was just too high and the
  railing was too flimsy.  I like this picture because it really
  captures the sentiment of the trip.  Vancouver was a beautiful city,
  but unexpectedly gritty and a little dangerous, and we had to
  experience it with just a bit of hesitation.</p>
<p>Time to get going.  Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  If you
  too messed up last night&#8217;s dinner, don&#8217;t sweat it.  Just keep your
  cutting board clean, your knives sharp, and try again tonight.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a Wednesday!</p>
