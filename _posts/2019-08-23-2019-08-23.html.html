excerpt: typing, errands, sauce, and chess

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  And happy Friday to you all.  I think it&#8217;s
  safe to say that we made it to the end of the week.  I love writing
  blog posts on Friday.  Not only does Friday put me in a good mood, but
  having a whole work week to look back on, there&#8217;s plenty of things to
  write about.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty light day of work.  In the morning, I helped a
  friend with their python script, then finished putting my paper
  together.  While combing my essay for errors, one of the interns asked
  why I put two spaces after each period.  I was pretty tickled by that,
  because it comes up every now and then.  The Internet will tell you
  that double spacing after periods is a relic from typing on a
  typewriter, and it exists in the modern world thanks to old people.
  But I meet enough young people that also practice <i>ye olde double
  tap</i> - enough to question that theory.  Maybe you don&#8217;t have to be old
  to put two spaces after a period.  I acknowledge that it&#8217;s
  unnecessary, but I challenge any single spaced heathen out there to
  try it on a really clicky keyboard, then tell me it&#8217;s unnecessary.</p>
<p>After getting my essay out, I decided to snoop around and do some work
  reading.  I have been working with the interns all summer, and I was
  starting to feel as if I was in my own bubble.  I spent a good hour
  pulling on threads, reading meeting notes and announcements.  It can
  be fun starting with a public announcement, then following the bread
  crumbs all the way back to the project kickoff or first proposal.</p>
<p>After work, Rodney, Marissa, and I made our way to the suit store so I
  could get measurements taken.  As the attendant was measuring me,
  Rodney yelled out &#8220;GOOD JOB DADA&#8221; each time my arms went up or down.
  I guess it&#8217;s nice to get so much positive affirmation from my son for
  doing so little, even if it means everyone else in the store
  snickering.</p>
<p>We ate dinner at Portillo&#8217;s.  As we ate, Marissa and I discussed their
  barbecue sauce.  If you haven&#8217;t been initiated, Portillo&#8217;s makes their
  own barbecue sauce and it&#8217;s pretty delicious - but as we discussed
  yesterday it must be the sugar.  I feel like an old fashion sauce is
  really tangy and pickly, but Portillo&#8217;s sweetens the heck out of it.
  If you close your eyes and focus, you can almost imagine it being made
  like a BBQ flavored cake frosting.</p>
<p>After dinner, we stopped by the Jenny Street grocery store.  We&#8217;re
  having the interns over to make pizza, so we wanted to get the good
  ingredients.  Jenny Street has a great cheese selection.  We picked up
  some mozzarella, pecorino, parmesan reggiano, and though they didn&#8217;t
  have any provolone, they had something called <i>provolono</i> that looked
  and felt like provolone, so I took a gamble.</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, I caught up on emails and other random
  tasks, watched some YouTube, and played a few games of chess.  To my
  disappointment, I discovered the computer has been set to &#8220;easy&#8221; all
  along.  Last night, it got check mate in only five moves.  You really
  need to be careful, even while playing defensively.  If you don&#8217;t move
  enough pieces, you can get sniped by a bishop and fall victim to a
  very impressive trap.</p>
<p>Today will be a lot of meetings, but for the most part I&#8217;m just
  sitting back as an observer.  We&#8217;re meeting with the interns to get
  feedback from them so we can improve the intern program.  I&#8217;m also
  hosting a big presentation to the rest of Madison engineering, giving
  the interns a chance to show off what they did this summer.  I saw
  most of the slides yesterday, I think it will be a good show.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Friday today.  Play some chess - even if
  you&#8217;re terrible at it.  It&#8217;s still fun to see how many different ways
  you can lose.</p>
