<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning!  Hope everyone is having a wonderful weekend.  On
  Friday, we had the interns and Andrew over for the end of the summer
  pizza party I had been promising.  It was a great time, and it was
  actually pretty easy to get two pizzas in and out of the oven with all
  the extra help.  It was a great evening of reminiscing.</p>
<p>Talking to newly graduated interns must have put me in a nostalgic
  mood.  Later that night, I was procrastinating cleaning up after the
  party by hanging out in the basement with Marissa while she cut
  frames.  I started rifling through my &#8220;keep&#8217;s sake&#8221; bin, which is
  filled with photos, school papers, notes, and strange little trinkets
  from my childhood.  I have an old coke I got on a train going through
  the grand canyon, and it&#8217;s still filled with coke.  As I explained to
  Marissa, it&#8217;s not valuable or anything - I just made a pact with Kelly
  to not open our respective coke bottles.  I think it was just to
  bother Sarah, who immediately opened hers and quickly drank it on the
  train.  But there it is twenty years later still unopened, and I&#8217;m
  pretty sure Kelly hasn&#8217;t opened hers either.</p>
<p>We went to bed late on Friday, and gave ourselves a late start
  Saturday morning.  I finished cleaning the kitchen from the party, and
  made some Dutch babies.  We were eating a big breakfast because our
  plans would take us on a bus to the Farmer&#8217;s market.  Now this was
  technically our first time at the Weekend farmer&#8217;s market, but I had
  walked by the much smaller Wednesday market plenty of times, so I was
  expecting about a dozen vegetable stands, and maybe a food cart or
  two.  I had no idea that on Saturday&#8217;s during the summer, they shut
  down the whole square and the booths pretty much wrapped all the way
  around the capital.  It was a bit of a fiasco.  Rodney, Marissa, and I
  quickly got overwhelmed waddling through the crowd.  But we regrouped
  at Starbucks, and after spending some time in the AC drinking familiar
  coffee, we got a second wind and perused the rest of the shops.  We
  picked up some kale, cherry tomatoes, apples, and a beautiful stalk of
  sunflowers.  We also picked up a bag of kettle corn to share before
  heading over to the terrace to conclude our day on the square by
  having a drink with our friend&#8217;s Alex and Cassie.  It was their sixth
  anniversary on Saturday, and we were pretty honored they were spending
  time with us.  Being long time Madison locals, we&#8217;ve grown to trust
  their perspective on Madison, and it was a relief to hear them
  validate our frustrations with the over-crowding at the weekend
  farmer&#8217;s market.</p>
<p>After catching the bus home, Rodney, Marissa and I took a long nap,
  waking up some time around 6:30.  I was loosely committed to cooking
  something for dinner, but that ship had sailed, and we decided to walk
  to Ian&#8217;s pizza.  We had been out and about all day, but the dogs would
  appreciate the exercise, and they get plenty of attention when we walk
  to the new location in our neighborhood.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;m pleased to say we made it to church.  We&#8217;ve had a
  bit of a dry spell, but with the help of bacon, hot coffee, and me
  weaponizing our toddler into the most persistent alarm clock ever
  devised, we made it to the early summer service.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s been the weekend thus far.  In a few moments, I&#8217;ll go get
  started on making ricotta basil gnocchi.  This is another suspenseful
  redemption recipe.  I tried Gordon Ramsay&#8217;s potato gnocchi a few
  months ago, and it resulted in such a spectacular, sopping, burnt
  failure that we ordered Domino&#8217;s.  This evening, I place my trust in
  Chef John, who discloses a egg, cheese, and flour based gnocchi that
  promises to be a lot less complicated.  We&#8217;re also turning our
  farmer&#8217;s market haul into a simple raw kale salad, so even if the
  gnocchi doesn&#8217;t turn out, at least I&#8217;ve finally earned my &#8220;Madison
  Farmer&#8217;s Market Hippie&#8221; badge eh?</p>
<p>Hope you all have a great weekend.</p>
