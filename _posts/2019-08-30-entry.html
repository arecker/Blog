<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning!  We&#8217;ve made it to Friday, everyone.  Yesterday was a
  good day.  I got lots of work done, tried a new sandwich place for
  lunch, and made a pretty good dinner.  We had a fire drill at work
  yesterday.  I saw the upcoming announcement and decided to create a
  little calendar event so everyone could plan around it.  Nate made me
  laugh because just before the drill, he leaned in and asked with a
  very serious face &#8220;In the event of a real fire, will you still put it
  on my calendar.&#8221;  Of course I agreed.  Fire or not, you got to keep
  the calendar up to date.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a &#8220;heads down&#8221; kind of week at work, and I think I needed
  that.  It felt good to jump back into things, listen to music again,
  clean up my notes, and take lots of quiet time.</p>
<p>After work, I took Rod to Hy-Vee to pick up stuff to make
  <i>saucijzenbroodjes</i>.  We&#8217;ve gotten pretty good at that meal now, so it
  usually turns out pretty great.  And I say <i>we</i> because Rod helped.
  I&#8217;m impressed with how much he&#8217;s picking up, in some aspects he&#8217;s
  genuinely helpful.  Yesterday he grabbed a basting brush out of the
  drawer while my hands were still covered in raw beef.  When we cut
  vegetables, we knows how to empty the bowl of off-cuts into the
  garbage.  And he also did a pretty respectable job sprinkling the
  <i>broodjes</i> with sesame seeds.</p>
<p>I also learned yesterday that you can make gravy really quickly if you
  need to.  I had just filled the dishwasher and we were waiting for
  everything to come out of the oven, when I suddenly remembered that I
  forgot to make the gravy.  I had even set aside a small amount of
  leftover beef stock for this purpose.  So I sent Rod upstairs to get
  mom while I melted the butter, threw in flour, and added the stock.
  It was ready five minutes later, along with everything else, and
  nobody was none the wiser.</p>
<p>After dinner, Marissa graciously offered to put Rod to bed, so I made
  my way to the couch.  The long, productive week must have finally
  caught up with me because I fell asleep watching YouTube videos.  It
  felt good to not move, and not think about anything for an hour.</p>
<p>I &#8220;sobered up&#8221; from the nap with a hot cup of tea, and Marissa made
  her way downstairs so we could watch a few episodes of Handmaid&#8217;s
  Tale.  Season 1 really turned a corner last night.  We had been
  talking about how difficult the first leg of the season was to get
  through.  It felt about as bleak as Game of Thrones, only with the
  shock and horror cranked way up.  But last night&#8217;s episodes we watched
  started to get interesting, a little more hopeful, and some character
  development is really happening now.  I figured it was only a matter
  of time that things started to work out for Offred.  &#8220;Why else would
  they invest so much in making us feel depressed for her.  If they
  never gave her a win, that would be completely wasted investment,&#8221;
  Marissa and I discussed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a difficult show to get through.  The episodes are long, and
  there&#8217;s a lot of horrible themes.  But it&#8217;s keeping us interested -
  I&#8217;d say so far it&#8217;s a solid <i>B</i>.</p>
<p>Today, Marissa, Rod, and I are going to grab lunch somewhere on the
  square.  Maybe we&#8217;ll try the sandwich place I went to yesterday, or
  maybe we&#8217;ll feel like sitting somewhere familiar and having a beer.
  After work, we&#8217;re going to make a pizza, then I&#8217;m going to try to
  convince the family to sit outside by the fire and enjoy the cool
  night.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful weekend.</p>
