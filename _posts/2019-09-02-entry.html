<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, friends!  Happy labor day.  Hope you&#8217;re taking it easy
  this morning.  Our family is having a slow start - we just finished
  eating some breakfast out on the porch, and now Marissa and Rodney are
  watching Spider-Man on the couch while I knock out a journal entry.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a wonderful day.  Kelly and Jeremy spent the afternoon
  with us.  They got to our place around lunch time.  We heated up some
  leftovers and let the kids burn some energy in the backyard.
  Afterwards, we walked to the biergarten.  We had such a wonderful
  time.  It felt good to catch up and chat about anything that popped
  into my head.  We also had some great toddler synergy happening.  I
  think when you have at least two toddlers in the same room, you have a
  golden opportunity to play their bombastic energy off of each other
  and tire them out for later.  Rod was so tired last night that he
  almost fell asleep while I was reading.</p>
<p>It was also pretty great to &#8220;nerd out&#8221; about raising toddlers.  Having
  a young kid, I sometimes get a little self-conscious that I talk about
  my kid too frequently.  I&#8217;m not an egregious offender, but there&#8217;s
  enough young parents floating around society that give us a bad rap.
  You know the type - the kind that tie everything back to the kid
  they&#8217;re raising.  The kind that will never let you forget about their
  kid, no matter how tangential or wildly unrelated it was to what you
  were already talking about before they started showing you pictures of
  them in the bath.</p>
<p>All that to say is that the stigma is real, and even parents with
  enough self awareness to know that the eyes of the world are not
  actually watching them raise their child still worry about
  over-sharing.  &#8220;Do I talk about my kid to much?&#8221; is a question that
  crosses my mind every time I show someone a picture or tell a funny
  Rodney story.  But all bets are off when you&#8217;re with another family
  like Kelly and Jeremy.  They&#8217;re in the trenches with us, and it felt
  good to trade war stories about tantrums, sticky fingers, and public
  urination, unhindered by the nagging little thought /&#8221;do I talk about
  my kid too much?&#8221;/</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re taking it slow because we&#8217;re planning on getting a
  lot of stuff done.  First, we&#8217;ll probably go to home depot.  Marissa
  needs some art stuff, and I was going to peruse the grilling
  department to see if they carry anything that can clean a poor Weber
  grill that is caked with a few summers of soot and neglect.  To be
  honest, I&#8217;ve never cleaned my grill before.  Marissa surprised me once
  and managed to clean half of it, and that was the best it ever looked
  (besides when it was coming out of the box).  But I knew I had to
  clean it at least once this summer, which is why I committed to
  loading it into the car and driving it to the class reunion this
  weekend.  I knowingly cornered myself into cleaning it.</p>
<p>After cleaning the grill, Rodney and I are going to make some
  <i>peposa</i>.  It&#8217;s a great recipe for long days at home, because after
  you load everything into the crock pot, you have no choice but hang
  out in the kitchen and straighten things up for a few hours.  Once I&#8217;m
  happy with the kitchen, I was going to use the rest of the time before
  dinner to work on some code.  Marissa and I had an idea for making a
  family &#8220;hub&#8221;.  As I&#8217;m currently picturing it, it&#8217;s just going to be a
  website with a bunch of shared apps and tools.  Right now I&#8217;m working
  on a home chores module - something that will keep track of who is
  supposed to do what and how often.  I&#8217;m even thinking about wiring in
  some friendly slackbot action so each morning you&#8217;re reminded of what
  you&#8217;re supposed to get done.  I find the chores module particularly
  exciting, because for the longest time I&#8217;ve been keeping it all in my
  personal notes.</p>
<p>After dinner, we&#8217;ll ride out the weekend scaries together.  Marissa
  and I have some more TV to watch, but I&#8217;m thinking about making
  another batch of <i>palmiers</i> to bring into work.  I tried them last
  night, and they turned out really well.  It&#8217;s a puff pastry &amp; sugar
  biscuit folded in such a way that when baked, it puffs up into a
  little heart.</p>
<p>Hope you all enjoy what&#8217;s left of your holiday weekend.  Take it easy,
  grab a loved one, and drink a beer with them outside.  The rest of
  your week depends on it.</p>
