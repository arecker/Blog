<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cloudy, chilly, misty morning, and even though I&#8217;m still
  waiting for coffee to finish brewing, the smell of fall that hit me
  when I stepped outside to let the dogs out was enough to wake me up.
  Of course, now I&#8217;m back in side and I&#8217;d rather have coffee, but for a
  second it was pretty magical.  The weather says it&#8217;s supposed to be on
  the cooler side all day - it shouldn&#8217;t get above 70 today, which makes
  me really eager to take a family walk to Glass Nickel for lunch.  The
  cozy work-from-home vibes are in full effect this morning.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty solid day.  It felt good to put on a real
  outfit (something other than my weekend <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/39c928c1-b001-44db-8481-d4e78fbc1015#HkMx93d76SS.copy">lazy pants</a>) and head into the
  office.  I was kind of bummed that my cookies didn&#8217;t turn out.  The
  batch was perfectly edible (we&#8217;ve been snacking on them at home), but
  they were just an impractical, grotesque form factor and I didn&#8217;t
  think they earned the right to make a debut at the office.  I
  mentioned them before our morning meeting, and my coworker Heath joked
  &#8220;Nope, sorry - you only get credit for making us cookies when you
  bring the cookies.&#8221;  Which is undeniably true - there&#8217;s no sense
  talking about cookies that didn&#8217;t happen.  That&#8217;s just some Midwest
  candor setting me straight.  Throughout the day, I was visualizing the
  thin sheet of rolled out puff pastry, and I think I came up with a way
  to fix my cookies.  I&#8217;ll try tonight and report back.</p>
<p>So what else is going on?  Ah, we&#8217;re training a new member of our team
  this week.  Two of our summer interns accepted jobs and one of them
  was back on our team the following Monday.  It&#8217;s exciting having fresh
  perspective around, but bringing someone up to speed can be daunting.
  At this point, I&#8217;ve been with my work for a little over three years,
  and even in that brief amount of time things have changed so much.
  There&#8217;s a lot of information.  And if that information were a body of
  water, training new people feels like teaching somebody surf.</p>
<p>After work, I took Rod to Hy-Vee, and Marissa wanted to come along.
  We were surprised to see that Rod kind of had a bad attitude about the
  change in routine.  &#8220;Momma go painting,&#8221; he scolded as he pointed
  upstairs.  After some undisclosed disciplinary action, he caved, and
  we all jumped in the car.  We decided not to play any music to give
  him space to think through things.  The whole thing was just a
  sobering reminder that my kid is turning into a real person with his
  own agenda.  He has his own sense of what&#8217;s normal, and he wants to
  weigh in on what we do - and not in the cute way where he just blurts
  out things like &#8220;WATERSLIDE&#8221; and &#8220;BASEBALL&#8221; at inappropriate times,
  but in a meaningful way - where we may feel like doing something but
  still have a hard time communicating it.</p>
<p>Today should be a good day.  I&#8217;m going to drink coffee and rock my
  lazy pants and drink coffee until my morning meeting, then the new
  hire and I are going to do some more &#8220;surfing lessons&#8221;.  Marissa, Rod,
  and I are going to walk to Glass Nickel for during lunch time, and you
  can be sure that I&#8217;m making another batch of cookies tonight.  But as
  we know, I don&#8217;t get credit for them until people are eating them -
  don&#8217;t let me off easy.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful day today.</p>
