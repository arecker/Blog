<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday at work, I noticed that almost everyone was Greenbay Packers
  jerseys.  It felt like a coincidence at first, but then I walked by
  someone who was <i>completely</i> decked out - cheese hat, face paint, and
  all.  This led me to bring it up in our morning stand-up.  &#8220;What did
  the Packers do?&#8221; I asked.  &#8220;It&#8217;s the first game of the season
  tonight,&#8221; someone replied.  &#8220;They&#8217;re playing the Bears.&#8221;  The team
  exchanged knowing smirks.</p>
<p>I had a pretty regular day at work.  Lots of writing code and time
  spent in my headphones, which gave me time to think.  I thought about
  the Bears.  I&#8217;ve never been to a Bears game, but I&#8217;ve worn Bears
  Pajamas &amp; t shirts, and I used to watch the games on TV with my dad.
  I remember going to a super bowl party with church fiends, where we
  ate nachos and chicken wings and watch Rex Grossman throw something
  like a dozen interceptions for the world to see, and all my friends
  and family yelling at the TV.</p>
<p>I thought about sports.  Deep down, I&#8217;ve always feared that I jinx
  sports teams.  I followed the Chicago Blackhawks very closely in sixth
  grade.  I watched just about every game on TV, and I even got
  permission from my teacher to write last night&#8217;s score on the
  chalk board every morning.  It was a really <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_Chicago_Blackhawks_season#Regular_season">terrible season</a>.  They
  didn&#8217;t make the playoffs, and immediately after the NHL shut down for
  almost a whole season due to salary disputes.  I&#8217;ve always wondered if
  I jinxed the season by watching.</p>
<p>After getting home, Marissa, Rod, and I jumped in the car to run some
  errands.  Marissa and I talked about the game.  She noticed all the
  Packers gear out in the wild too, and independently found out there
  was a big game tonight.  Occasionally, we have the &#8220;which sports
  teams does are family support&#8221; discussion, and it was especially
  relevant then.  &#8220;I could probably support the Packers,&#8221; Marissa
  added.  &#8220;My family would give me crap because they&#8217;re all Vikings
  fans, but we live here now, and we should be proud Wisconsinites.&#8221;</p>
<p>I winced.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I could bring myself to wear anything with a
  Packers logo.  Do you think you could actually put on a Greenbay
  Packers shirt?&#8221;  Marissa shrugged.  &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t see why not.  I
  think the Jerseys are cool.  What&#8217;s your issue with it?&#8221;  That was a
  good question, and I didn&#8217;t have a good answer.  At the time of
  writing this, I don&#8217;t think I have a single Bears logo in the house.
  But apparently I&#8217;m still enough of a Bears fan to instinctively hate
  the Packers.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;It must be just
  psychological at this point.  I&#8217;m getting a little anxious just
  picturing myself as a Packers fan, and I feel guilty just imagining
  it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa smirked, &#8220;I guess we&#8217;re Bears fans.  We should watch the game
  tonight and support them.&#8221;  I admired her bravery.  She was convinced
  that she could follow any sports team she wanted, and from what I know
  about Minnesota, defecting to the Bears is equally as treacherous as
  defecting to the Packers.</p>
<p>When we got home, I put the game on the TV.  Rodney instinctively sat
  on the couch on my lap with his milk and settled in.  Having sports in
  the house constitutes a special occasion and is worthy of extending
  bedtime, so I decided to sacrifice story time and let him stay up to
  watch a few more drives.  He watched the Packers take the lead and
  score a touch down.  To give him the full football experience, I even
  yelled at the TV.  &#8220;AH C&#8217;MON!  Dang it.&#8221;  He happily joined me in my
  feigned enthusiasm.  Even though I don&#8217;t follow sports too closely,
  I&#8217;ve always enjoyed making little comments to myself between plays and
  trying to sound savvy, and Rodney was enjoying it.  The second quarter
  ended with the Bears still trailing.  I muted the TV and ushered
  Rodney up to bed.  He took a final sip of milk, then quietly said to
  himself &#8220;Go Bears.&#8221;  We trudged up the stairs for bedtime.</p>
<p>The Bears lost last night.  Maybe I jinxed them by watching the game,
  just like I did to the Blackhawks in sixth grade.  But apathy and
  superstition doesn&#8217;t excuse me from the fight.  From what I&#8217;ve
  observed all my life, being a Bears fan is fraught with heartbreak and
  disappointments.  But my family has chosen this path, and we walk
  together.  Fellow Bears fans, I&#8217;ll see you Sunday at 3:25PM.</p>
<p>Go Bears.</p>
