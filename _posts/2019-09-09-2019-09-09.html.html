<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  It&#8217;s so dark in the mornings now.  With all
  the rain clouds still hiding the morning sun, it feels like I woke up
  in the middle of the night, and it&#8217;s making me want to crawl back into
  bed for a few more hours, even after finishing this coffee.  But
  little does my body know that it&#8217;s actually 7 AM on Monday morning,
  and it&#8217;s time to roll.</p>
<p>Last night, I tried to make pea soup.  It was also cold and drizzly
  yesterday, and I pictured us sitting on the back porch under the
  umbrella - maybe under a few blankets - eating hot pea soup.  But that
  never happened, I sort of botched the recipe.  For some reason, the
  peas cooked, but they never dissolved into a puree, even after boiling
  the hell out of them for the last half hour.  I finally declared the
  recipe edible by 8 PM, but by then I had already lost my temper and we
  didn&#8217;t feel like eating outside.</p>
<p>I lost my temper.  Still trying to figure that out.  I stopped keeping
  an anger journal a few months ago because I was pretty satisfied with
  the revelation that I lack patience, and that leads to outburts, but I
  decided that just knowing the problem is isn&#8217;t enough to fix it.  I
  need to practice.  So I created an &#8220;Anger&#8221; section in my notes and
  kicked things off with the great Sunday night pea soup meltdown.</p>
<p>After dinner, I hung out with Marissa in the dining room while she put
  the finishing touches on some pieces.  Today she&#8217;s sending a bunch of
  her paintings to be put on display at a restaurant in Rochester.  Our
  dining room looks like a very compact art gallery - all the finished
  pieces propped up on display.</p>
<p>I tried working on some code.  I wanted to play around with setting up
  a server in google cloud, but google cloud was being stupid, and after
  getting all wound up over dinner I knew I wouldn&#8217;t have the patience
  to deal with it, so I shut the laptop and just decided to binge some
  cooking videos on YouTube.  And I&#8217;m glad I did - I picked up a lot of
  good tips and recipes I&#8217;d like to try, including a bacon &amp; asparagus
  dutch baby.  Oh yeah, you heard me right.  This is a dangerous for our
  family.  Once we make a <i>savory</i> dutch baby, that opens a door into a
  universe where we eat several dutch babies per day.  In the morning
  we&#8217;ll eat a classic breakfast dutch baby, then for lunch maybe a pizza
  calzone version, and then for dinner, maybe a rustic french style
  hunter&#8217;s trilogy dutch baby.  Of course we&#8217;d make another dutch baby
  just before bed as a snack.  Of course I kid.  Tonight we&#8217;re going to
  try out this asparagus bacon version.  It doesn&#8217;t get coated in
  powdered sugar, so it plates up more like a puffy quiche, and that&#8217;s
  not a very controversial choice for dinner, is it?</p>
<p><i>Sip.</i> We&#8217;re going on four days without a coffee maker.  We&#8217;re
  scraping by with the french press, but I&#8217;ve forgotten how cold and
  gritty it gets toward the bottom.  Additionally, prepping a french
  press before going to bed is much less satisfying then prepping a
  coffee maker.</p>
<p>So what else is going on.  Ah, I&#8217;m on ticket duty this week.  I&#8217;m
  mentally revving up to be very attentive and proactive with helping
  people today.  Which is good, I have some podcasts to catch up on, and
  that makes the day go by pretty quickly.  I haven&#8217;t checked in on my
  regular podcasts in a while, but I ran out of music to listen to and
  feel like changing things up.  Last night while doing the dishes I
  listened to Uhh Yeah Dude.  I like the podcasts that are loyal to a
  certain format, because when you pick them up again it feels like you
  never left.</p>
<p>Man, this morning I feel like I&#8217;m really squeezing my brain to get the
  words out.  I guess I&#8217;m having kind of a mentally quiet morning.  And
  that&#8217;s OK, there&#8217;s a time and a place for every way you feel.  Maybe
  you&#8217;re having a quiet morning too, and this morning you don&#8217;t feel
  like bursting through the doors at work with a big smile on your face
  like you&#8217;re running for office or something.  Maybe it&#8217;s the kind of
  morning where you&#8217;ll just grab a cup of coffee, get under a pair of
  headphones, and get to work until lunch.</p>
<p>No matter how you feel this morning, I hope you have a good day.  If
  you&#8217;re with me and you&#8217;re feeling quiet, let&#8217;s use the time to
  mentally charge up and reflect.  Hope you all have a wonderful Monday
  morning.</p>
