<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  It&#8217;s yet another cozy, drizzly day here in
  beautiful Madison Wisconsin.  This morning&#8217;s coffee turned out a
  little better.  I thought I had ground the beans a little too finely,
  but I like the extra kick this morning.  Still eagerly waiting for the
  new coffee machine to get here in the mail, this french press requires
  way too many decisions in the morning.  At this point, I&#8217;m kicking
  myself for not just buying it at target.  I&#8217;m not sure why ordering it
  on Amazon felt convenient or more timely.  Amazon is great for things
  that you eventually need - like socks, shoes, and surge protectors.
  But I should have anticipated how annoying waiting around for a coffee
  maker would be.  <i>I really of think [I] <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/163ecd4b-0182-4c79-b3b8-9e4f810ca139#BJYeObfSLr.copy">screwed the pooch</a> on this
  one.</i></p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  Work was pretty busy, but I made it
  through my checklist and even had time over lunch for some side
  missions.  Lately I do this thing where alongside my work todo list, I
  make a list of personal things I&#8217;d like to get done over my lunch.
  Yesterday I emailed a friend, then as silly as it sounds I read up on
  the Bears&#8217; Quarterback Mitch Trubisky.  I&#8217;m really trying to take
  football seriously, so each day I&#8217;m going to try to bring myself up to
  speed with something, and with football the QB is probably the best
  place to start.  I didn&#8217;t realize that Mitch Trubisky was such a new
  part of the team.  We only drafted him in 2017, but according to
  Wikipedia he really started clicking in last season.  The bears made
  it pretty far into the playoffs, then were eliminated with a
  heart-breaking missed field goal.  I definitely remember that.
  Marissa and I watched the entire game.  We thought the Bears were on
  their way to the super bowl, so we wanted to jump on the fair weather
  fan train earlier in the playoffs to make the final more exciting.  As
  a result, we witnessed every painful moment of that last field goal
  attempt.  During that game, I guess I was too preoccupied with the
  kick to notice how well Mitch played.  He&#8217;s a solid QB, and I&#8217;m happy
  to have him on our side.  I&#8217;m looking forward to the game this Sunday.
  It&#8217;s right in the middle of Rodney&#8217;s naptime, and football games are a
  great excuse to hang around the house and cook something a little on
  the junkfood side.  I&#8217;m thinking about making some nachos or buffalo
  wings for the occasion.  Today, during my lunch I&#8217;m going to read up
  on our head coach Matt Nagy.  I&#8217;ll peruse his Wikipedia page, then
  pull on a few internet threads from there.</p>
<p>After work yesterday, I made that asparagus &amp; bacon dutch baby with a
  side of mushrooms.  It was a pretty easy recipe, so Marissa hung out
  in the kitchen while I worked.  It was nice to catch up after a long
  work day.  She had a pretty busy day schlepping paintings up to
  Minnesota.</p>
<p>The dinner turned out great.  It was kind of like a cross between a
  quiche and a country omelette, but you can&#8217;t go wrong with crusty
  cheese, egg, and bacon in cast iron, so that&#8217;s no surprise.</p>
<p>We put Rodney to bed, then Marissa and I began our quiet hobby night.
  She painted, and I worked the whole night on <i>the hub</i>.  I was hoping
  to finish up the chores tracker, but I decided to rewrite the whole
  site from scratch and I just about broke even.  It was for the better
  though, I was over-complicating things and I&#8217;m much happier with it
  now.  I&#8217;d rather not bore you with the details.</p>
<p>So looking forward, I think we just have a regular Tuesday on our
  hands.  I don&#8217;t have any leftovers today, so I might indulge in some
  tacos.  Belair has a great $2 beer &amp; taco special on Tuesday, so you
  can get a pretty solid lunch and beer for only a couple bucks.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Eat tacos and get your
  work done.</p>
