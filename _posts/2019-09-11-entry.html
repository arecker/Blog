<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  And happy Wednesday.  I&#8217;m pleased to report
  that the coffee situation here at home has returned to normal.  We
  un-boxed our fancy Hamilton Beach coffee maker last night.  As I was
  opening it up, I started to question why I went with the exact same
  $20 model as before - if you&#8217;re getting something on Amazon you may as
  well shop around, read the reviews, and see what&#8217;s out there, right?
  Apparently I don&#8217;t.  I think I even searched for the exact machine by
  make and model.  But maybe that&#8217;s a good thing.  There&#8217;s a notch cut
  out at the end of our coffee bar that fits one of these exactly, and
  what a scandal it would be if I got a different machine that didn&#8217;t
  fit there!  But I played it safe, I got the same model, it fits snugly
  in the notch, the french press can go back to being a contemporary
  hipster decoration and I can go back to just complaining about the
  beans. This week I went against my better judgment and picked up some
  random &#8220;fair trade&#8221; coffee from the Jenny Street market.  I&#8217;m all for
  fair trade, but I&#8217;m suspicious of any coffee in which that is the
  <i>only</i> thing they have to brag about.  Really?  You&#8217;re putting <i>that</i>
  front and center on the bag?  No &#8220;premium quality&#8221; or &#8220;established in
  1985&#8221;?  Not even one of those &#8220;J.D. Power &amp; Associates awards&#8221;?</p>
<p>This fair trade coffee was not even sold by the actual coffee.  I
  bought it by the keurigs and hot chocolate and other tangentially
  cafe-related nonsense.  In the back of the grocery store by the
  checkout, there&#8217;s a wall of real coffee beans, a bean grinder, and a
  lot of blends that I recognize from local coffee shops, but I&#8217;m just a
  bit too shy to figure out how it works.  It looks like a big todo,
  asking the cashier to grind it for you, telling them which blend you
  want and how much.  I&#8217;m just waiting until I hit my personal tipping
  point, where my discomfort outweighs my shyness - my <i>activation
  energy</i>, if you want.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m all out of journaling ideas.  We&#8217;re scraping the bottom of the
  barrel, if you hadn&#8217;t noticed.  To add some content to these morning
  journaling sessions, I jot down things I can talk about as they pop in
  my head at work or while doing chores, and the list is almost empty.
  <i>Almost</i>.  I&#8217;ve been sitting on one bullet point for about a month now
  and I just haven&#8217;t worked it into our conversation, so instead of
  doing this organically I&#8217;m just going to drop it in.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some days, I feel like if somebody put a gun to my head, I <i>might</i>
    admit that the only album I ever really need to survive is Beyonce&#8217;s
    Homecoming Live album.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I took this down while I was doing the dishes, when I blast the more
  energetic selections in my music library.  Beyonce&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming:_The_Live_Album">Homecoming: Live</a>
  album is a frequent guest in the rotation.  There&#8217;s some dull spots,
  but the first leg is really energetic and gets me really pumped up to
  clean the kitchen.  Sometimes I ask myself which album I&#8217;d take on a
  desert island with me, and on any day of the week I&#8217;d answer <i>Blonde</i>
  by Frank Ocean - with a secret copy of <i>Endless</i> burned on the
  opposite side of the CD, but this random thought in my notes proves
  that for a few seconds when the sink water gets hot and the Queen B
  starts bumping that I briefly live in a universe where Beyonce is all
  I need.  But I would only admit this in dire circumstances.  In the
  words of a good friend of mine, Frank Ocean is my music collection&#8217;s
  youngest child.  Frank is the baby of the family, and no matter what
  he does (or in his case, how infrequently he makes music), he&#8217;ll
  always be my favorite.  Beyonce might be my middle child.  I don&#8217;t
  have a lot in common with her, but I need her around for balance.
  Kanye is my wayward eldest son.  He embarrasses me a lot, and I don&#8217;t
  want to talk about what he&#8217;s up to and what he&#8217;s saying, but at the
  end of the day I love his music and he&#8217;ll always have a place in my
  collection.</p>
<p>So there we go.  That wasn&#8217;t so hard, was it?  It&#8217;s equally daunting
  and inspiring staring at an empty &#8220;ideas&#8221; section in my notes now that
  I just let the last one fly.  I&#8217;ll try to be extra attentive to my
  thoughts today so we can repopulate it.  Otherwise I&#8217;ll just end up
  using our time together in the mornings to talk about all the
  intricacies of my morning coffee routine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working from home today.  Marissa&#8217;s dog class was cancelled, so
  the whole family is hanging around the house with me.  We&#8217;re thinking
  about eating lunch at home, then going for a quick walk in the middle
  of the day.  Normally we eat out on Wednesday afternoon, but we&#8217;ve got
  some good leftovers in the fridge, and we had better eat those before
  I add to the chaos tonight.  For dinner, we&#8217;re going to attempt Korean
  BBQ beef, some white rice, and if I&#8217;m feeling really crazy I&#8217;m going
  to make some rangoons to go along with them.  I can feel my fingers
  swelling from the sodium already.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Thanks for reading, and
  I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.  Happy Wednesday!</p>
