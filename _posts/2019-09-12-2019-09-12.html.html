<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Dang it.  Overslept again.  I sat up in bed at 7:08 AM today, a full
  38 minutes after when that&#8217;s usually supposed to happen.  Not too much
  important stuff happens during that time.  I usually just sleepily
  empty the dishwasher while waiting for coffee to finish brewing, let
  the dogs out, then at 6:55 AM I sit down at the computer and pretend
  to write.  Along with writing down ideas throughout the day, that&#8217;s
  another trick I&#8217;ve found to make journaling easier in the morning.  I
  found that if you take five minutes to bring yourself into the moment
  and focus on the act of writing, the words come easier.</p>
<p>But like I said, all that went out the window this morning.  It&#8217;s 7:15
  AM at the time of writing this, so you&#8217;re either going to get a
  shorter entry, or a normal entry preceding me running to the bus stop
  in a panic.</p>
<p>I stayed up pretty late working on my new blog format.  It&#8217;s always
  one of those projects that kind of takes over your night, and before
  you know it &#8220;little tweaks&#8221; turn into full blown rewrites, then of
  course you have to finish it before the morning when it&#8217;s writing
  time.</p>
<p>But that being said, I hope you like it.  It&#8217;s feeling like a regular
  website now, isn&#8217;t it?  Last night while I was hacking away, I thought
  about my blogging journey, which started long before the daily journal
  cadence.  I used wordpress, django, medium, jekyll.  I used to spend
  days writing articles, trying to make people laugh, rile them up about
  something, and teach them about tech.  I used to use a lot of inline
  images with snarky captions, kind of like the <i>Cracked</i> articles I
  used to read in college.  I used to post the entries all over reddit,
  hoping to get discovered, and I&#8217;d obsessively watch the analytics.</p>
<p>It was good to take a break from it all.  When I started journaling
  every morning, it wasn&#8217;t even about blogging.  It was just about
  warming up for the day, centering my self, and having a place to leave
  honest thoughts.  But it turned out to be exactly what my struggling
  blogging voice needed.  I learned to write for myself - not reddit or
  facebook.</p>
<p>Sixty-seven entries ago, I started posting the journal entries online
  again.  The danger of fixating on the image of my blog was still
  there, so I proceeded back into the public internet with great
  caution.  I wrote a little script that would convert the latest five
  entries to HTML and publish them to the Internet.  I knew that if it
  was any more complicated then that, the bells and whistles would
  distract me from the writing.</p>
<p>So this blog is the next evolution of that.  I&#8217;m still just running a
  simple little script to convert the entries to HTML, but it&#8217;s a little
  more <i>gussied</i> up.  It should be easier to read on your phone, and all
  the entries are saved permanently, so feel free to share and bookmark
  the entries you enjoy, they&#8217;re not going anywhere.</p>
<p>My favorite part about this system is that I&#8217;m still totally
  abstracted away from the sensation of having a blog.  I&#8217;m still
  writing in my text file, like I have been since the beginning.  I
  don&#8217;t even stick around to watch it publish, after I kick of the
  script, I just jump into the shower and let the automation take over.
  I&#8217;m kind of like a super villain triggering a doomsday device every
  morning.  It&#8217;s easier to focus on the content that way, along with the
  real reason I&#8217;m journaling every day.  I&#8217;m not tracking views, sending
  out subscriptions, or trying to get noticed on reddit anymore.  I&#8217;m
  not even trying to amuse you, rile you up, or make you laugh.  I&#8217;m
  journaling because I like the way it makes me feel, and I like the
  effect it has on the rest of my day.  If you&#8217;re out there reading, I
  really appreciate the readership, but I&#8217;m not keeping score.  I&#8217;m
  still moving forward without a &#8220;comment platform&#8221; or tracking
  viewership through analytics, so feel free to either enjoy it in
  anonymity, or send me an <a href="mailto:alex@reckerfamily.com">email</a> to out yourself - that&#8217;s wonderful too.
  Who doesn&#8217;t love getting emails?</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Thursday today.  I need to jump in the
  shower, then frantically run to the bus stop like a kid who is late
  for school.</p>
