<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone, and happy Saturday.  I&#8217;m struggling this
  morning, it&#8217;s been a really tough weekend thus far, and I don&#8217;t even
  know where to begin.  I&#8217;ll tell you this, the theme of this weekend is
  &#8220;broken software&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yesterday at work, we had a pretty severe outage.  It was nobody&#8217;s
  fault, and everyone was just doing their job, but one of the systems
  that my team manages failed and took down our production services for
  most of our customers.  I&#8217;m on call this week, so I was paged in the
  late morning.  My whole team would shortly jump in, so I hardly felt
  alone, but incidents suck.  Trying to fix things during an incident is
  nothing short of a horrible out of body experience.  Suddenly, you
  feel like a stranger at your own computer.  You feel every painful
  passing second in slow motion, and yet somehow the whole day
  disappears.  The incident lasted about three hours, I think.  I was
  supposed to take a half day yesterday, but by the time we called all
  clear it was into the afternoon.  I packed up my stuff, gave a few
  friendly waves to my weary, shell-shocked team, then left the building
  and walked toward my house down East Wash for about an hour.  Marissa
  and Rodney scooped me up somewhere by the Yahara bridge with a bag of
  Portillo&#8217;s.</p>
<p>It actually took a bit of time for the negative thoughts to creep in.
  At first I was still high from the adrenaline, and quite proud that we
  managed to restore the service at all, but the feeling wore off and I
  was pretty down in the dumps for the rest of the night.  We tell new
  people at work a number of platitudes, like &#8220;we&#8217;re a blameless
  culture&#8221;, &#8220;breaking things is part of the job&#8221;, and &#8220;shit happens,
  let&#8217;s do better next time&#8221; - all very true and healthy perspectives,
  but it&#8217;s hard to practice what you preach.  What always gets me is
  reading angry tweets from customers.  It bothers me that something I
  was responsible for kept people from getting their work done.</p>
<p>After Rodney&#8217;s nap, I took him to the grocery store.  I was tempted to
  wallow around in my sweatpants for the rest of the day, but I knew
  that getting out of the house and doing something that didn&#8217;t involve
  technology would feel good - and it did.  Rodney and I had a great
  time walking around the grocery store.  The Jenny Street Market had
  pumpkins lined up along every aisle, and Rodney was jazzed.  You
  should have seen his face when I told him we could get one, he just
  about crapped his pants from excitement.  He carried the tiny pumpkin
  around like it was a sacred relic.</p>
<p>When we got home, I cooked a pizza while Marissa painted and Rodney
  watched TV.  We normally make <i>sfincione</i> on Friday, and we have to
  kind of rush it into the oven so we don&#8217;t eat late, but having a head
  start allowed to me to take my time, listen to music, and do some
  thinking.  After the pizza was out of the oven, we took it over to the
  Malthouse and ate on the back patio.  We stayed there for about an
  hour until it was Rodney&#8217;s bed time.</p>
<p>Marissa put Rodney to bed, and I decided to sit on the deck and
  continue to enjoy the cool fall air.  I started a little fire in my
  grill and put on some music.  I was so comfortable, that I actually
  nodded off for about a half hour, waking up when Marissa joined me
  outside.</p>
<p>My night started to get better.  Marissa and I talked for a bit out by
  the fire, then made our way inside to watch <i>Rambo 2</i>.  We were in the
  mood for a stupid action movie, and <i>Rambo</i> is one of those movies I
  like to periodically check in on to see how poorly it&#8217;s aging.  And
  it&#8217;s true, Stallone looks so uncomfortable clambering through the
  jungle.</p>
<p>Just as the weekend started to take an upturn, I woke up this morning
  to a fried file server.  It appears at some point, my home file
  server&#8217;s boot drive failed - the kind of error that would go unnoticed
  for weeks until you finally decided to reboot it - like I did this
  morning.  I&#8217;m not going to lie to you, reader - I lost my temper, and
  I had a new one for the anger journal.  I&#8217;m just about fed up with
  software breaking.  Sure, home projects like this aren&#8217;t critically
  depended on.  The only consequence of this outage is a wife and son
  that will have to just stick with Netflix for the next few days, but
  for people like me, home tech projects are supposed to be kind of a
  refuge from the software problems at work, and it still sucks when
  they break.</p>
<p>I was tempted to skip journaling today, but just like when I forced
  myself to take Rod to the grocery store, I knew that deep down it
  would be good for me to take pause before losing myself in fixing
  things.  It felt good to share how I&#8217;m feeling, and I&#8217;m already in a
  better mood.  Thanks for reading.  I hope you all have a great
  weekend.  Now if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I have a file server to fix.  I had
  better brew some more coffee.</p>
