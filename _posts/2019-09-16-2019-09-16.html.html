<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  I just stepped outside to let the dogs.  The
  morning air is cool, and there&#8217;s a thick layer off fog resting on
  everything.  It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s going to get up to 80 degrees
  today - and all week.  Yuck.</p>
<p>This weekend was pretty great.  It started off a little rocky with the
  outage at work, but it appears I just needed some family time, good
  food, and of course, a little football.  For those keeping score, the
  Bears won yesterday.  What a wild game!  We held off Denver up until
  the last quarter when they inched ahead with an embarrassing two point
  conversion.  I thought that we were done for.  We had about 30 seconds
  remaining, and up until that point our offense had been pretty
  underwhelming, and I was doubting we&#8217;d be able to make it anywhere
  close to field goal range.  But miraculously, Trubisky completed a
  pass with one second remaining, which was just enough time for Eddy
  Pineiro to drill a 53 yard field goal.  Given how our last season
  ended, Chicago fans deserved to be on the winning side of a clutch
  field goal situation.  I&#8217;m happy we got the win, but the game
  demonstrated we still have some serious jitters to sort out,
  particularly in our offense.  It appears we&#8217;ve over corrected and
  chosen to disproportionately run the ball, and I hope that didn&#8217;t get
  in Trubisky&#8217;s head, because he had some pretty terrible passes (except
  for the last).  To borrow from a reddit comment, winning that game
  felt like walking away from a bloody crime scene.  I will say this, we
  have a hell of a kicker and a hell of a defense, and I think we can
  work with that.</p>
<p>It was an exciting game, and even though it probably shaved a few
  years off my life, it was fun to yell at the TV and celebrate.
  Marissa and I agreed that we weren&#8217;t expecting football to get so
  exciting so quickly.  I thought we would have to pay our dues and
  watch at least a handful of dreary, scoreless losses or something.</p>
<p>After the game, we sat down to eat some chicken wings.  I made a batch
  of Chef John&#8217;s RAM wings (which stands for <i>Rosemary Ancho
  Molasses</i>).  They were pretty good - definitely the best batch of
  wings I&#8217;ve ever made.  And that&#8217;s no surprise, I believe Chef John
  hails from West New York, so I imagine he knows what he&#8217;s doing.  They
  were a bit too spicy for Rod, so tossed an odd combination of sliced
  turkey, mayo, and pickles.  Half way through dinner, we all broke out
  into laughter when Marissa goaded Rod to eat, saying &#8220;Rod, eat some
  more of your&#8230; uh&#8230; stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>After dinner, I worked a bit on the file server while Marissa painted,
  then we reconvened sometime around ten to watch TV.  We found a new
  show called <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=video&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjm48CzqtXkAhXLs54KHXHsDkoQtwIIKDAA&amp;url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv%253D6uWCNHQgfnc&amp;usg=AOvVaw2SNv0YArO6mT7QLA1OYfnH">Undone</a> that instantly sucked us in.  We&#8217;re already over
  half way done with the season, but the episodes are brief and
  engaging, and as long as they aren&#8217;t setting me up for a terrible
  ending, it&#8217;s already joined the ranks in my all time favorite TV
  shows.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful for this weekend.  Work was really tough on Friday, and I
  was worried I wouldn&#8217;t be able to shake it off, but with enough family
  time, football, movies, chicken wings, hobbies, and naps by the fire,
  I forgot all about work.  This morning, it&#8217;s back to reality.  This
  week we have a lot of clean-up to do.  I tried to stay off work slack
  all weekend, but it&#8217;s safe to assume I&#8217;ll spend most of today helping
  to compile a report for the outage on Friday and working on what
  broke.  It will probably derail our team&#8217;s plans for this quarter, but
  I think that&#8217;s fair.  An outage like the one we had on Friday should
  be a bit of a wake up call.  I&#8217;m ready to jump in, knowing I have my
  arsenal of relaxation waiting for me when I get home.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  If you too are feeling the
  Monday blues, try to remember all the wonderful, relaxing things you
  have waiting for you at home.  Bear down, readers.</p>
