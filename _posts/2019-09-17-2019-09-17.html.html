<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>The coffee is really good today.  Yesterday I went to the Jenny Street
  Market, and it wasn&#8217;t very busy, so Rod and I finally figured out how
  to buy whole bean coffee.  It&#8217;s a bit of a to-do, so I&#8217;m glad I
  waited.  You have to walk away from checkout to fill the bag, and then
  the cashier has to weigh the beans.  I went with <i>Del Sol</i>, the
  morning blend, and even when brewed with our uninspiring coffee maker,
  it tastes pretty next level.</p>
<p>This morning I&#8217;ve got work on my mind.  I spent pretty much all day
  yesterday documenting Friday&#8217;s outage.  My team did some research on
  Friday, and I did some of my own Monday afternoon.  This morning, we
  have our post mortem meeting.  These things feel very official, and
  even though my work does a really good job keeping things objective
  and blameless, I can still get defensive if I don&#8217;t watch myself.
  This morning I&#8217;m just trying to get in the right head space for a very
  friendly, amicable technical cross examination.</p>
<p>Yesterday I finally went off call, and I enjoyed the solitude today.
  For lunch I grabbed a sandwich from Starbucks, then I sat on the
  terrace and stared out at the water.  It wasn&#8217;t as hot outside as I
  thought it would be, and the as always water had a very calming
  presence.  There were still a few monarch butterflies hanging out by
  the flowers.  I thought those butterflies were supposed to take their
  winter migration pretty seriously, but maybe if they find a place they
  like, they hang out for an extra week or two - there&#8217;s probably room
  for that kind of freedom in the butterfly community, right?</p>
<p>After work, I took Rod to the market, and we picked up stuff to make
  Kibbeling.  As always, I got plenty of cod and shrimp, but I also
  tried out some perch.  The perch looked pretty cool while it was
  frying.  The thin strips puffed up in the hot oil, and the skin
  blistered.  I&#8217;m also learning to be a little less shy with the heat.
  I really cranked the stove and allowed the oil to reach the upper
  300&#8217;s, and it came out a lot crispier.  I also left the shrimp in for
  almost a full minute after I&#8217;d normally take them out, just as an
  experiment.  It&#8217;s tricky finding a balance between getting it crispy
  and cooked just right.  I used to talk a lot of crap about the fried
  fish they sell on Fridays at restaurants around Madison, but I&#8217;m
  finally coming around to how difficult it is to perfect.  When you&#8217;re
  frying fish, there&#8217;s a lot of room for choice, and also a lot of room
  for error.</p>
<p>After dinner, Marissa gave Rod a bath, then handed him off to me to
  put to bed, which is a pretty classic way to divvy up the bedtime
  routine.  After getting his pajamas on, Rod wanted to spend a few
  minutes jumping around like a frog.  Lately, he really likes to stall
  during bedtime, so every inane step of the bedtime routine has the
  potential to turn into a big time waster if you&#8217;re not vigilant.
  He&#8217;ll stop brushing his teeth to look out the window, then he&#8217;ll tell
  you a story of the time he saw a cat in the neighbor&#8217;s window, then
  before you know it he&#8217;s grabbed a brush out of the bathroom closet and
  started to scrub the bathroom walls (the painted walls).  When we
  finally make it to bed, his new trick is asking to read the story
  instead of me, which was charming at first, but he&#8217;s quickly realized
  that when he&#8217;s got my attention it&#8217;s much easier to burn minutes after
  the official bedtime of 7:30, hamming it up with stories, throwing his
  voice into his stuffed animals, and pretending to talk on the phone to
  family members.</p>
<p>After putting Rod to bed, Marissa sanded frames outside, and I sat out
  there with her and drank a beer.  It felt good to just enjoy the
  conversation without having to keep an eye on my phone in case I got
  paged.  The day after my on-call shift ends, I joke that I &#8220;stick my
  phone in a drawer all night&#8221;, and it&#8217;s not far from the truth.  I
  usually put on music and just leave it in the kitchen.</p>
<p>After the post mortem today, I&#8217;m probably going to feel like a mid day
  beer, so Marissa and Rodney are going to meet me for lunch for taco
  Tuesday.  It will feel nice to finally close the book on Friday&#8217;s
  incident.  We&#8217;ll have to spend a few weeks focusing on preventative
  measures, but that&#8217;s not so bad.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Thanks for reading.</p>
