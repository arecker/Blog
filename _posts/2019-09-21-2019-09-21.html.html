<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Saturday to you.  I had a great start to
  the weekend.  At work, morale improved, as we finally started to make
  some progress with recreating some of the conditions for the incident
  last week.  We&#8217;re starting to find answers, and the new discoveries
  had a positive effect on everyone.  I spent a good amount of time
  performing &#8220;chaos testing&#8221;, which basically just involves standing up
  a copy of your service in an isolated environment and breaking it in
  various ways, looking for weak points.  Yesterday, I set up 100 VMs
  that did nothing but submit a giant text file to our service.  I
  wanted to create a lot of network noise, so in an homage to one of my
  favorite movies, the payload just included <code>ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES
  JACK A DULL BOY</code> <i>ad infinitum</i>.  For lunch, I grabbed a wrap from the
  Good Food cart and ate it on the terrace, staring at the water.</p>
<p>After work, Marissa, Rod, and I went out to eat at Sal&#8217;s pizza.  Sal&#8217;s
  is a solid pizza place.  It&#8217;s difficult to park there, and it&#8217;s pretty
  busy during dinner, but it&#8217;s one of those places where you just need
  to call ahead before you leave, and it all works out.  I wolfed down
  one of their small thin crust pizzas, then polished off the rest of my
  beer while Marissa and I chatted about the neighborhood.  We set up
  this little Friday outing to check out a new part of the city and
  start gathering intel for when we move someday - not that it&#8217;s
  happening any time soon, but Marissa and I feel differently about it.
  The thought of moving terrifies me, so we agreed to occasionally go
  for walks in different neighborhoods just to start easing me into the
  idea of living somewhere else someday.  We parked the car in a
  lake-side neighborhood on the other side of the Yahara river, walked
  around the block, and sat at the playground for a while.  If we had
  done this thing three years ago, I probably would have been defensive
  and felt the need to play devil&#8217;s advocate, pointing out everything in
  the neighborhood that troubled me for fear that if I didn&#8217;t, we&#8217;d be
  throwing our stuff in a moving truck the next day.  But I didn&#8217;t.
  Maybe I&#8217;m a little wiser now, but I decided to just walk, listen, and
  keep my opinions to myself.  It paid off, because Marissa decided she
  didn&#8217;t like the neighborhood much either.  Looking back, I probably
  could have avoided a lot of arguments that way.</p>
<p>After finishing our lap around the block, we jumped in the car and
  went home.  I put Rod to bed, then spent some time cleaning the
  kitchen.  I shirked some of my chores on Thursday night when I fell
  asleep on the couch, and it felt good to get things under control
  again.  I even used some extra lettuce and tomatoes to pack a lunch
  for Marissa to take to her agility trial this weekend.  Don&#8217;t tell
  her, but she thinks I wrote a heart felt note on the napkin, but all
  it says is &#8221;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RoP1LKMeM">I&#8217;M PRISON MIKE!</a>&#8221;.</p>
<p>After chores, we finally finished up the movie Hitch.  I barely paid
  attention to the ending.  I was working on some code for my website,
  but I&#8217;m pretty sure everything worked out for Hitch.  Sure, it got a
  little rough for a minute when Sara Meelas assumed the worst about
  him, but Hitch really took his sweet time clearing the air, didn&#8217;t he?
  He waited until the end of his dramatic speech before making it clear
  that he <i>didn&#8217;t</i> work with the gross guy that seduced her friend.
  Really Hitch?  You could have started with that piece of information
  and put everyone at ease.</p>
<p>This morning, Rodney and I are hanging around the house watching
  Thomas the Train while Marissa and Ziggy drive to an agility
  tournament in Milwaukee.  Rod and I are doing a bit of potty training.
  Up until now, Marissa&#8217;s been fighting the good fight alone, so I
  wanted to get some hours in myself.  Update - we&#8217;re on our fourth pair
  of underwear and Rod has only been up for about two hours.  What&#8217;s
  amazing to me is how quickly he can urinate.  I look away for two
  seconds, then suddenly he&#8217;s standing in a puddle of water, wringing
  out his underwear.</p>
<p>After I finish journaling, we&#8217;re going to take a walk to the grocery
  store, and if the weather stays decent, we&#8217;re going to shoot hoops at
  the community center.  Later today after I get dinner going, I&#8217;m
  hoping to get some programming in.  I&#8217;d like to finish cleaning up the
  script that publishes my blog, and I&#8217;ve been dying to get some time
  with my new miniature kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day today, and thanks for reading.
  Remember, before you get defensive with someone you care about, wait a
  few extra minutes to see if you actually disagree.  It doesn&#8217;t have to
  be a long time - just a few minutes.  Which is apparently enough time
  to piss your pants twice.</p>
