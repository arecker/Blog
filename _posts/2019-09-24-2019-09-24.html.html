<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  How are you feeling today?  I&#8217;m feeling
  pretty good.  The cool mornings make it a little easier to wake up.
  These days when I let the dogs out first thing in the morning, I don&#8217;t
  mind waiting on the deck without any shoes on.  The morning chill is
  kind of exhilarating.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a great day.  I worked, heated up some leftovers for
  lunch, then went for a long walk in the afternoon.  After work,
  Marissa, Rod, and I went to Hy-Vee.  We made Philly cheese steaks, and
  finished eating just before the 7:15 kickoff.</p>
<p>The Bears played the Redskins yesterday, and I have some thoughts
  about the game.  First off, Trubisky looked really good out there.
  It&#8217;s no secret that our offense sucks, but I hope last night&#8217;s game
  put to rest the notion that it&#8217;s Trubisky&#8217;s fault.  I think he looked
  a lot more natural out there last night, especially when he was
  scrambling out of the pocket.  I know everyone says he needs to work
  on planting his feet and being calm after the snap, but I personally
  enjoy watching him make throws while on the run.  He&#8217;s good at it, and
  to all of you Trubisky naysayers, ask yourselves this - if he&#8217;s such a
  terrible quarterback, why isn&#8217;t he throwing interceptions?  Sure, he&#8217;s
  kind of inaccurate when he throws for long, but you have to give him
  credit.  He knows what he can do, and more importantly, what he can&#8217;t
  do.  I was pleased to seem him connect a few long passes - I think he
  could use the stats and the confidence - but if we keep scoring
  touchdowns with 5, 6, 7 yard passes, I&#8217;m not complaining.</p>
<p>What <i>was</i> clear last night is that our offensive line needs to figure
  things out.  Trubisky must have been sacked a dozen times last night,
  and one of them almost resulted in a safety.  I think if a quarterback
  keeps getting sacked, it probably has more to do with the coverage
  than with the play calling or where the QB is standing.</p>
<p>The game as a whole was a bit of a roller coaster.  At first it was a
  blowout, then we gave up a field goal.  Then we let the Redskins think
  they were making a comeback for almost a quarter and a half.  I would
  have liked to see us keep the pressure up and just beat them by 72-0
  (which from what I read, was an actual score of a Redskins v Bears
  game once), but I suppose it could have been worse.</p>
<p>During the game, I also hacked a bit on the chores website.  I came
  across a blog post called &#8220;Think Before You Use NodePort&#8221;, which to
  sum up, was part of a really hacky solution I was getting ready to
  slap together.  Thanks to the quick research win, I got the final
  pieces together and deployed the little website at home.  I set up an
  account for me and Marissa, then we entered our Tuesday chores.  I&#8217;m
  looking forward to removing the sprawling &#8220;chores&#8221; section from my
  notes.</p>
<p>After the game, Marissa and I chatted a bit on the couch, then
  continued watching our movie of the week.  It was my pick, and I went
  with <i>Mr. Bean&#8217;s Holiday</i>, which is a pretty solid movie.  I didn&#8217;t
  have subtitles for the French dialog, but Marissa and I agreed that
  that wasn&#8217;t a deal breaker for a movie about Mr. Bean.  You could
  easily figure out what the French characters were saying just watching
  how Mr. Bean reacted to everything.</p>
<p>I forgot how good of a movie it was.  I&#8217;m impressed that despite
  having lots of sketch material to work with, they didn&#8217;t recycle any
  of it.  Did you know Willem Defoe is in the movie too?  He plays a
  pretty good angry, delusional movie director.  And the whole thing
  comes together really nicely at the end.  Can you imagine?  A movie
  about Mr. Bean screwing around in France on vacation actually hands a
  touching, ironic ending.  Not to mention some great characters.  They
  really went above and beyond with this one.</p>
<p>Today should just be a regular Tuesday.  I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going
  to do today, or what I&#8217;m making for dinner, or what I&#8217;m going to do
  after dinner.  I&#8217;ll probably do some chores, then work on my lesson
  plan for Kids Code this week.  I don&#8217;t have a plan.  This morning I
  feel like Mitch Trubisky, I&#8217;m scrambling out of the pocket, and I&#8217;m
  going to try to make a throw on the run.</p>
<p>Have a great day readers.</p>
