<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re having a wonderful Thursday
  morning.  The cold, rainy weather is a great excuse to hid in a pair
  of headphones under your favorite hoodie.  That&#8217;s probably what I&#8217;d be
  doing today if I were at work, but I have the next two days off.
  We&#8217;re driving to Chicago for Auntie Sarah&#8217;s (and Uncle Phillip&#8217;s)
  wedding.  In a few moments I&#8217;ll wake everyone up, we&#8217;ll start packing,
  and we hope to hit the rode by noon.  I love car trips, don&#8217;t you?
  Driving in the rain is less than ideal, but if you bring some good
  music and good coffee, car trips are a great time to talk and relax.</p>
<p>Yesterday I worked from home, but I still had a pretty busy day
  wrapping up and documenting my week&#8217;s project.  At the end of the day,
  we had a little meeting with the whole team where I walked through my
  notes.  In the end I finally got things working, and I was grateful
  for that.  It&#8217;s always better ending a work week on a high note.
  After work, Rod, Marissa, and I drove to Hy-Vee to pick up some
  supplies to make a deep dish pizza.  We got the usual corn meal for
  the dough, raw Italian sausage, and marinara, but I also picked up a
  can of <i>San Marzano</i> tomatoes.  Chef John talked about how special
  these are on his channel, and the first time I saw them in Hy-Vee I
  did a double take.  I cooked the red sauce using the whole can,
  letting it simmer down for almost an hour and a half.  The tomatoes
  were pretty magical, and absolutely lived up to their reputation.
  I&#8217;ve never been too crazy about the way I make pizza sauce, so this is
  a pretty big win.  Always happy to have another secret weapon in my
  back pocket.</p>
<p>While waiting for the pizza to come out the oven, Rod was in a silly
  mood.  He was &#8220;sneaking&#8221; around the house with his flashlight,
  alternating between me and Marissa.  He&#8217;s peak his head into the room,
  then while hunched over with knees bent, he&#8217;d take these weird springy
  steps into the room leading with his tiny LED flashlight.  Then he&#8217;d
  turn around, head upstairs, and do the same thing to Marissa.  He did
  this at least three times while the pizza was in the oven.</p>
<p>After eating dinner, we let Rod pack some toys for the trip, then I
  put him down for bed.  Marissa got to work assembling her new gallery
  desk, and I cleaned the kitchen.  We had a lot of food in the fridge
  that was getting close to expiring, so while cleaning I sliced
  bananas, baked some potatoes, and prepared a few more leftovers to eat
  before hitting the road.</p>
<p>Ah, speaking of cleaning.  I happened upon a great cleaning tip last
  night.  I&#8217;ve always wondered about the best way to dispose of a really
  chunky red sauce - like the one I made last night for the pizza.  Last
  night it occurred to me to pour the sauce through a strainer, rinsing
  with plenty of water.  If you keep it under hot water for about five
  minutes, soon the entire sauce coalesces into this little puck of
  tomato meat and spices, and then you can just flip it into the garbage
  can like a pancake.  Meanwhile, your drain and drain catcher are
  completely clean, since the strainer was doing all the work.  I was
  pretty proud of myself for coming up with that one.</p>
<p>After cleaning the kitchen, Marissa and I reconvened on the couch to
  finish watching Fantastic Mr. Fox.  I brought some potato chips and
  little bit of hot sauce.  It was cold and rainy pretty much all day,
  and I it felt good to warm my throat with something spicy.</p>
<p>After we finished Fantastic Mr. Fox, we kept the party rolling and
  started watching Blackkklansman, which is one of the first movie picks
  we&#8217;ve had which neither of us have seen.  We&#8217;re about half way
  through, so far it&#8217;s a pretty cool &amp; interesting cop movie.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great day today.  For some of you, I&#8217;ll see you at my
  sister&#8217;s wedding.  For everyone else, stay dry out there.  Be sure to
  have your favorite hoodie and your favorite bottle of hot sauce on
  hand.</p>
