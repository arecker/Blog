excerpt: unpacking and movies
---
<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning readers!  I just let the dogs out, fed them, and caught
  up on dishes.  As I was unlocking the baby gate up stairs, from the
  corner of my eye through Rodney&#8217;s cracked door, I could see him
  lunging back into bed, as if he was doing something wrong playing with
  books.  Marissa and I have told him a bunch of times that now that
  he&#8217;s in the big boy bed, he&#8217;s allowed to get up and play quietly, but
  he still feels the need to sneak around I guess.</p>
<p>Yesterday we hit the road sometime in the late morning, getting home
  around one.  The rest of the day was pretty lazy.  We let Rodney watch
  TV on the couch, Marissa napped, and I slowly chipped away at
  unpacking the car.  I expected to get a surge of motivation and finish
  it all, but it never came, and I still have probably 30% of the way to
  go.  Sometime around 10:15, I came to the realization that it wasn&#8217;t
  happening the same night, and I instead joined Marissa on the couch to
  finish watching our movie pick <i>Blackkklansman</i>.  As we watched the
  last third, I assembled my new raspberry pi case, which will replace
  my journaling computer once my micro-HDMI cable arrives by mail.</p>
<p>Blackkklansman was a good movie.  I had listened to a podcast about
  this story, so I was a little biased.  Mostly, the movie stuck to the
  facts.  And I don&#8217;t mind a little creative liberty for the sake of
  fitting something into a movie, but I think all the things Spike Lee
  added didn&#8217;t really add much to it.  Also, he went a little overboard
  on the racist dialog.  For example, there were a lot of ten-to-fifteen
  minute long monologues from the various klansman characters peppered
  with probably the most racist dialog you could imagine, and as the
  camera is sitting still or just slowly zooming in during the delivery,
  it got a little too intense.  I guess if the goal was to make me
  uncomfortable, he succeeded.</p>
<p>Despite being over the top at times, the movie was also insanely cool
  at times.  There were a lot of cool throwbacks to the genre of 70s
  buddy cop films, and the music was undeniably delicious.  There was a
  moment where the main character was walking through a wheat field in a
  leather jacket while this slow electric guitar was playing, and I
  think I wouldn&#8217;t mind if that played on for several more minutes.</p>
<p>After watching <i>Blackkklansman</i>, we decided to start another movie
  while I finished my beer.  Marissa picked the original <i>Blade Runner</i>
  with Harrison Ford, and I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit that I don&#8217;t think
  I&#8217;ve seen it.  Neither has Marissa, and in retrospect it may have been
  good to have watched this one before the new one.  I was a little
  rusty on <i>Blade Runner</i> lore and had forgotten what &#8220;replicants&#8221; were
  and what it meant to &#8220;retire them&#8221;.  &#8220;For a movie made in the 80s,
  this looks really amazing,&#8221; remarked Marissa and we both marveled at
  the dazzling special effects and scenery.  As the movie opened with
  Harrison Ford getting arrested at a noodle bar, I remarked &#8220;you ever
  notice that every good sci-fi movie begins with a regular guy getting
  hauled off somewhere while he&#8217;s trying to eat?&#8221;  The other example I
  had in mind was in <i>Hitch Hiker&#8217;s Guide</i> when Arthur is still wearing
  his bath robe when Ford helps him escape earth as it&#8217;s getting
  demolished.</p>
<p>I can hear Rod opening and closing the drawers under his bed.  Those
  drawers are usually pretty empty.  One of them just has his pair of
  spider-man slippers, but for some reason he feels the need to
  rearrange things.  In a few moments, I&#8217;ll head up to his room and put
  away his laundry, then the plan is to take him to Jenny Street.  We&#8217;re
  going to buy things to make breakfast and lunch.  The Bears play today
  at noon, and it would be nice to have everything I need to make
  breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Today is a good day to get back on the
  cooking wagon.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Bear down, and I&#8217;ll see you
  all Monday morning.</p>
