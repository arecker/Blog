<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone.  On this drippy, cold day I hope you have
  something warm to wear, and a nice hot cup of coffee to sip on.  This
  morning I overslept, sitting up in bed at 7:00 AM - a full twenty to
  thirty minutes after I usually get up.  That added lots of variety to
  this morning.  As I briskly made my way down the stairs to let the
  dogs out and get them their breakfast, I rearranged my morning in my
  head and concluded it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad.  And it&#8217;s not bad, so long
  as I don&#8217;t spend too much time writing.  Normally going five minutes
  over just means I have five fewer minutes to get ready, but today it
  will mean five fewer minutes to catch my bus, which is a lot harder to
  do.  But I&#8217;m here now.  My backpack is packed for work, I&#8217;ve got my
  shoes on, and I&#8217;m going to see how much of this delicious coffee I can
  drink before I need to fly out the door to the next adventure.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s theme was &#8220;frustration&#8221;.  Work started out well enough,
  but something in my JIRA permissions got screwed up and I needed to
  wait for IT to fix it.  I did as much work as I could, but that small
  thing kept me from getting a production change out yesterday, and I&#8217;ll
  have to find time for it today.</p>
<p>I guess &#8220;frustration&#8221; is a little dramatic.  I still got plenty of
  work done.  My Monday morning <code>Today</code> list is always the biggest, and
  yesterday I killed it.  I caught up on work reading, worked through
  the morning, then over lunch I caught up on emails and educated myself
  on how to make chicken wild rice soup.</p>
<p>For lunch I heated up some leftover <i>peposa</i>.  And because &#8220;what are
  you eating&#8221; is a pretty common question when I heat up that heavenly
  piece of meat and fill the break room with smells of peppercorns and
  garlic, I&#8217;ve discovered it&#8217;s a lot easier to say &#8220;Italian chuck roast&#8221;
  then to explain what <i>peposa</i> is.  It also makes me sound a lot less
  like a foodie jagwad.</p>
<p>After work, I caught the bus home and found Marissa and Rodney raking
  the leaves.  From what I hear, they had a pretty action packed day
  that took them to the zoo, out to lunch at Portillo&#8217;s, running errands
  at Home Depot, and outside to clean up the yard.  Rod was actually
  having so much fun with her that he was dragging his feet to get in
  the car to go to Hy-Vee with me, despite being promised free bread.
  And when a toddler drags their feet, it&#8217;s in the very literal sense.
  He refused to walk, and his feet limply dragged on the ground as I
  carried him over to his car seat.</p>
<p>Rodney eventually got into it, and soon we were at Hy-Vee picking up
  what we needed to make for soup.  As Rod got in a better mood, I got
  in a worse mood.  Hy-Vee was having one of those days where they were
  out of everything, understaffed, and inexplicably busy on a early
  weekday evening.  They were out of garlic, fresh bread, and heavy
  cream.  The heavy cream particularly set me off because peering
  through the empty fridge, I could see a whole box of it sitting on a
  pellet.  If I didn&#8217;t have Rodney with me, I could have seen myself
  just playing dumb and wandering back there to get it.  There&#8217;s the
  theme of the day again - <i>frustration</i>.</p>
<p>The frustration continued at the checkout line.  Their card reader was
  acting up, and the guy in front of me had a pretty bizarre shopping
  payload stuffed into a single basket.  It was one of those shopping
  trips where you stand in line for twice the time it took you to find
  everything.  When it was my turn, the exhausted cashier asked &#8220;did you
  find everything OK?&#8221;.  For a second I thought about listing the things
  that they were out of, but I was afraid of sounding like a tool.</p>
<p>Rodney and I head home, and I started cooking the soup.  I was excited
  to try my remixed version of the chicken wild rice soup.  I sweat some
  onions and garlic in my dutch oven with nutmeg and cumin, then added
  chicken stock and sliced chicken thighs, allowing it to simmer for
  about twenty minutes before sneaking in a box of instant wild rice.
  In another saucepan, I melted a stick of butter and added a half cup
  of floor, whisking it together into a roux.  Slowly, I whipped in the
  half and half.  Once the rice had a few minutes to cook, I added the
  cream &amp; roux to the dutch oven and mixed.  At this point, I thought we
  were in trouble, because there were some clumps floating around, but I
  did my best Chef John impression and kept my composure.  He would have
  said &#8220;Don&#8217;t lose hope.  Just cover it and don&#8217;t touch it for fifteen
  minutes.  Hey that&#8217;s just you cooking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The soup turned out really well, and was a welcomed ending to a
  frustrating day.  As we ate, Rod and Marissa talked about their trip
  to the zoo and all the animals they saw.  Rod even brought his toy
  giraffe along, and I could only imagine his excitement when he was
  able to parade it around the real giraffes.  &#8220;What a giraffe party it
  was&#8221;, recounted Marissa.</p>
<p>After we put Rod to bed, Marissa worked on frames in her shop and I
  hacked on the hub.  Last night I finally fixed the data volume issue.
  The website is now happily reading and writing data to and from my
  NAS, and I fixed a number of bugs under the hood as well.  I added our
  chores back in, and out of excitement I even added a few extra to fill
  up Thursday evening and Saturday morning - respectively, straightening
  up the deck and cleaning out the car.</p>
<p>At 11, Marissa and I met on the couch to watch a little more of <i>Blade
  Runner</i>.  It was really bumming us out, but it got pretty good last
  night.  We have about twenty minutes to go.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my day.  In a few moments, I&#8217;ll slug the rest of this coffee
  and run outside to catch the bus.  I haven&#8217;t looked at my work
  schedule yet, but to the best of my knowledge it will feel like a
  Tuesday.  I&#8217;m going to get my change out into production, then pick
  another task and do my best to destroy it.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great day today, reader.  I don&#8217;t have time to
  proofread this, so typos be damned.</p>
