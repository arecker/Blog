<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re feeling refreshed this morning.
  I&#8217;m getting there.  Yesterday was great, except I had a twinge in my
  shoulder all day.  This morning it&#8217;s still there, but it feels a
  little better.  Don&#8217;t you just hate it when that happens?  By all
  accounts, sleeping on my back with my arms at my side on a travel
  pillow rolled under my neck is the ideal way for a human body to lie
  still for an entire night.  I can&#8217;t even imagine what went wrong.
  It&#8217;s a mystery to me.  I still sleep with arm braces at night to keep
  my elbow straight.  It was really tricky to figure out how tightly to
  fasten them.  There were a few weeks where I&#8217;d wake up every morning
  and both of my arms were completely asleep.  And you can&#8217;t have that.</p>
<p>OK - one more digression before I jump into the day.  When I was
  little, I used to think that my arms and digits falling asleep was
  completely unique to me, and I thought they it an early sign of
  developing super powers.  I used to watch this show on TV called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DAORNCSkGc">The
  Secret World of Alex Mack</a> which was about this teen girl whom, as a
  result of getting splashed by chemicals in an accident, could morph
  into a liquid blob and shoot electricity out of her finger tips.  One
  morning I remember sitting up in bed with a tingly arm, and I spent a
  few minutes holding it out in front of me trying to summon lightning.
  There was no lightening.  &#8220;Must still be developing,&#8221; I thought.
  Morphing into liquid goo was also an appealing concept to me when I
  was a child.  Between me and my sisters, locking each other out of our
  rooms when we were mad was a big power play.  The locks had a spring
  inside that could be opened with a little pin that we kept in the
  bathroom closet, but you could still keep the lock flush with the
  doorknob on the other side of the door to keep that from working.  Ah,
  but if I could morph into liquid, I could just seep underneath the
  crack in the door and re-associate as a solid on the other side.  The
  ultimate trump card.</p>
<p>Back to our regularly scheduled journal entry.  Yesterday was a swell
  day.  I&#8217;m on ticket duty this week, so I spent a lot of time bouncing
  between things and helping people.  Over lunch, I ate some leftover
  chicken wild rice soup and worked on my blog.  If you haven&#8217;t seen it,
  you should check out my <a href="https://www.alexrecker.com">homepage</a>.  I finally managed to fit all the
  previous blog posts on it in a way that didn&#8217;t seem cluttered.  For a
  while I convinced myself that it was just too much information for
  anyone to be interested in, but the second it was available I myself
  spent a good five or ten minutes browsing old journal entries and
  reading what I was up to at different times of the year.  Anyway, I&#8217;m
  pretty happy with this setup.  The next blog item I was planning on
  was going back and declassifying as many private posts as I can.</p>
<p>After lunch, I had a few meetings, then I jumped on the bus to head
  home for the day.  As the #15 bus bumped along East Wash, I
  frantically googled around for convincing hutspot recipes.  I was
  convinced the recipe wasn&#8217;t going to work - boiling potatoes is great,
  but adding the same weight of carrots and onions sounded a little
  obtuse, and I just couldn&#8217;t imagine a pot full of carrots cooking as
  quickly as potatoes, which made mashing them together at the end seem
  impossible.  But I kept the faith, and before long I arrived home
  ready to take Rodney to the store.  When I walked up the driveway, he
  and Marissa were decorating the front steps with Halloween
  decorations.  There were a few light up pumpkins, some spooky spider
  webs, and a light up corgi dressed as a bumble bee, which Rodney
  nicknamed <i>bumble bee puppy</i>.</p>
<p>After some toddler feet dragging, Rodney, giraffe, and I jumped in the
  car.  I was relieved that Hy-Vee wasn&#8217;t as busy as they were the
  previous day.  The parking lot was mostly empty, and we would have had
  an easier time moving through the aisles, but Rodney insisted on
  riding his giraffe like a horse.  This was as far from a brisk gallop
  as you could get, and more like a pensive trudge while dragging the
  stuffed animal between his legs.  By the time we got to the meat
  counter, I made him relieve giraffe to the shopping cart and walk next
  to me.  We drove home with potatoes, carrots, onions, kale, and bacon.
  Before I started cooking, I opened a box I got from amazon that had
  Marissa and Rodney&#8217;s Halloween costumes - suits from <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiDpq2qmo_lAhVCHqwKHaliBEkQFjACegQIABAB&amp;url=https%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FSpider-Man%253A_Into_the_Spider-Verse&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_0bqKwhrmvDmIKpBaUo26">Into the
  Spider-Verse</a>.  Later while I was cooking I would catch Rodney sitting
  on the couch wearing his black Spider-Man mask.</p>
<p>Marissa sat in the kitchen and chatted with me, helping me peel
  carrots.  We quartered the potatoes, carrots, and onions, piling the
  cuts up in the dutch oven and covering it with water.  I started the
  stove, then prepared the bacon and kale.  The water came to a boil,
  and I covered it.  &#8220;I just don&#8217;t see how this is going to work out -
  tonight might be a pizza night,&#8221; I said covering the pot filled with
  vegetables.  Thirty minutes later, I removed the lid and sampled a
  carrot.  Through the magic of dutch cooking (yet again), it was soft,
  sweet, and somehow took on a completely new flavor while just sitting
  in a pot of simmering water.  I drained the vegetables, then mashed
  them.  The bright orange carrots melted into the pale potatoes,
  turning the mixture into this soft pastel light orange color,
  sweetened by the yellow onions.  Just before calling everyone down for
  dinner, I heated up some leftover chuck steak - which wasn&#8217;t a cop
  out, hutspot is apparently supposed to be served with braised beef.
  We ate dinner, and the first few minutes were silent while we studied
  the new recipe.</p>
<p>As Marissa was giving Rodney a bath, there was a knock on the door
  from our nextdoor neighbor.  I let the dogs out the back, then joined
  her on the porch.  I don&#8217;t want to use my journal to air dirty laundry
  because this is a happy place for me, but it got pretty
  confrontational.  We&#8217;ve had an ongoing property line dispute.  Luckily
  this time we didn&#8217;t have much to argue about, since Marissa and I are
  finally just getting a surveyor out to lay down the line once and for
  all.  As a naive first time homeowner, the idea that someone could
  disagree about where our yard and their yard met seemed silly to me,
  and shelling out a few hundred dollars to get an official decision
  from the city seemed even sillier, but after spending some time on
  google, I was comforted to learn that property line disputes are
  pretty common, and one of the big reasons why surveying your yard and
  using a mediator are such a straightforward process.  In hindsight, a
  few hundred dollars seems like a small price to pay to never have to
  talk to my neighbor about that damn property line again.</p>
<p>She seemed pleased that a surveyor was coming, and she agreed to
  respect the outcome, then walked off in a huff.  I left to clean the
  kitchen, gritting my teeth as I washed dishes.  One tough lesson that
  I&#8217;ve learned through this whole thing is anger has a way of corroding
  you over time, even if you&#8217;re in the right.  I&#8217;m pretty sure my
  neighbor is wrong about the property line.  In a few days, I&#8217;ll be
  able to prove it with a document, and she&#8217;ll have to comply with it.
  You would think that Marissa and I would feel relieved and a little
  triumphant, but we&#8217;ve held onto this anger for so long that every
  outcome of this dispute just tastes bitter.</p>
<p>Marissa clicked around on Home Depot&#8217;s website, shopping for white
  picket fences.  &#8220;Good fences make good neighbors,&#8221; I remarked as
  Marissa let out a tired chuckle.</p>
<p>After we had finished winding down, we sat on the couch and watched
  the rest of Blade Runner.  Though it dragged at the beginning, it was
  a delight to finally see that dramatic &#8220;tears in the rain&#8221; ending in
  full context.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m working from home, hanging out with the Rodman in the
  morning while Marissa goes to dog class.  In a few moments, I&#8217;ll jump
  in the shower, then get him out of bed.  Oh, and I forgot to mention
  that today I&#8217;m writing the entry on my new computer.  I&#8217;ve upgraded to
  a Raspberry Pi 4, and I splurged on the model with 4 GB of RAM.  Emacs
  is a lot snappier on this computer, and it was a welcome upgrade.
  Shout-out to my folks for the birthday gift card that made it happen.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great day today.  Remember, reader - good fences make
  good neighbors, and there&#8217;s no sense in trying to settle a property
  dispute without a licensed surveyor.  That argument may as well be
  tears in the rain.</p>
