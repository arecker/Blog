<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  This is probably the best I&#8217;ve felt all week.
  After Wednesdays afternoon&#8217;s outage and Wednesday night&#8217;s pizza binge
  I was feeling pretty low energy.  I was also psyching myself into
  believing that I was coming down with a cold.  But it appears that all
  I needed was a good supper and a good night of sleep.  Do you ever get
  paranoid when you suddenly remember how long it&#8217;s been since you
  gotten sick?  I treat getting sick like jury duty.  If it&#8217;s been a
  while, I start to get suspicious that it is about to happen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spent most of the day documenting Wednesday&#8217;s outage.
  Since it wasn&#8217;t in an environment that impacted customers, no official
  post mortem was needed, but my team thought it would be a good idea to
  fill one out anyway just to show people that we weren&#8217;t messing
  around.</p>
<p>After I was done with the report, I went out to lunch with Rob.  We
  sat on the patio of Argus, where the waitress greeted him by name.
  Argus is clearly Rob&#8217;s place, and he made it feel like a scene from
  <i>Cheers</i>.  We ate some lunch, threw back a beer or two, and Rob let me
  finish his fries.</p>
<p>I worked on some other stuff in the afternoon, then head home to find
  Marissa and Rodney snuggling on the couch.  Marissa was taking a
  well-deserved couch nap after cleaning a few of the house windows.
  We&#8217;re planning on doing the rest of them this weekend, but she wanted
  to see what it would look like.  I immediately noticed the extra
  sunlight pouring into the kitchen, and it made me feel proud and
  happy.  I guess you shouldn&#8217;t underestimate what good windows can do
  to your mood.</p>
<p>I took Rodney to Hy-Vee.  Our fridge was pretty much empty, so we had
  a big shopping trip ahead of us, but Rod was also in a good mood and
  he was up for the challenge.  As we passed the snack food, he
  sheepishly gestured to a box of M&amp;M rice crispy treats, and after I
  nodded in approval he happily lobbed them into the shopping cart.  I
  let him eat one on the way home.  And with that treat, I hope he
  realized how pliable I am when it comes to snack foods in turn for
  helping me pick up groceries.  That&#8217;s the whole appeal of grocery
  shopping with your parents, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>For dinner, I fried some pancietta in olive oil at the bottom of my
  Dutch oven.  We had some really nice looking lemons in the fridge, so
  I couldn&#8217;t resist zesting one of them into the mix.  I dumped in a can
  of cheap red sauce, cooked it down, snuck in a tablespoon of butter,
  then tossed in a whole box of rigatoni.  After letting all that <i>get
  to know each other</i>, I folded in some parmesan cheese.  That&#8217;s my goto
  for making quick pasta on a weeknight, and for all intents and
  purposes it&#8217;s replaced the function of mac &#8216;n cheese in our house.  As
  we ate dinner, Rod and Marissa talked about their busy day working
  outside.</p>
<p>After dinner, Marissa put Rod to bed so I&#8217;d have time to help a friend
  set up her new iPad.  Over the phone exchanging plenty of screenshots
  over texts, together we navigated the perils of iOS, finally adding a
  new email account.  &#8220;IT WORKS THANK YOU,&#8221; she replied in the test
  email.  We were feeling pretty good about our success, then suddenly
  almost out of jealousy for the new device, her iPhone started acting
  up and suddenly she couldn&#8217;t send emails from that device.  We tried
  to work our magic, but around 10:45 we had to raise the white flag,
  since there&#8217;s only so much you can help with over the phone
  (especially when it comes to troubleshooting that same phone).</p>
<p>As a long time IT guy, I&#8217;m aware of how exhausting it can be, even if
  I&#8217;m the one helping you.  It still takes effort on your part to follow
  my instructions, describe what you&#8217;re seeing, and track with our
  progress.  My philosophy is that there&#8217;s nothing wrong with saying &#8220;I
  appreciate the help, but let&#8217;s take a break.&#8221;  It helps to step away
  from a problem, and sometimes they even fix themselves when we&#8217;re not
  paying attention.</p>
<p>I was disappointed in Apple.  Let&#8217;s be honest, for people that don&#8217;t
  have the time to treat computers like a hobby, Apple is the <i>de facto</i>
  choice.  I prefer Android - not because it&#8217;s good - but because it&#8217;s
  cheap.  This leaves Apple with the unique responsibility of
  shouldering the majority of the population - the people that don&#8217;t
  particularly enjoy using a computer.  There stuff has to be really
  good, especially when it comes to common scenarios.  It&#8217;s hard to
  describe how frustrating it is to encounter a bug while helping
  someone with a common use case.</p>
<p>I wise person once said &#8220;A computer is like an evil genie; it will
  give you exactly what you ask for, even if it&#8217;s not exactly what you
  wanted.&#8221;  Trying to configure an 2019 iPhone to read emails was a
  funny introduction to our evening movie pick <i>Minority Report</i>.
  Taking place in 2050, it has to hold first prize for <i>most
  technologically optimistic</i>.  Tom Cruise busily ran from flying cars
  to computers he controlled by waving his hands, and not once did I see
  him log into iCloud.  If that&#8217;s true, then we have 30 short years to
  clean this up, Apple.</p>
<p>Happy Friday, and hope you have a wonderful day today.  Be careful
  what you ask a computer to do, because it will do <i>exactly</i> what you
  asked.</p>
