<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Saturday.  It felt good to sleep in a
  bit and wake up to the first day of the year that really felt like
  fall.  We just finished breakfast, and my family is patiently waiting
  for me to finish up a journal entry before we head outside to clean
  the garage.  There&#8217;s something about chilly fall days that make you
  want to throw on a hoodie and work outside, and that&#8217;s probably what
  we&#8217;re going to do.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a great day at work.  We spent most of the day
  investigating some weird events in our service that happened the day
  before, but I took a break to grab lunch with Rob and Josh at the Old
  Fashioned.  Rob and I were grateful that had our favorite beer on tap.
  The beer is called <i>spruce juice</i>, and it tastes like a tall cold
  glass of George Clooney chopping firewood while wearing a sweater.  We
  split a whole pitcher.  &#8220;It&#8217;s cheaper that way,&#8221; said Rob.  &#8220;We&#8217;re
  saving a whole three dollars.&#8221;  &#8220;Not to mention the added camaraderie
  of drinking out of the same vessel,&#8221; I added.</p>
<p>When we got back, Zendesk was setting up for their national &#8220;Coming
  Out Day&#8221; celebrations.  I picked up a rainbow sticker and rainbow pin,
  and proudly donned it over my Bears hoodie.</p>
<p>While finishing up work, I got a message from Marissa saying that she
  had to take our car in the shop.  It turned out to not be such a big
  deal, but that meant that Friday night Sfincione was probably at risk,
  since she normally starts the dough in the early afternoon.  To add to
  that, she and Rodney were pretty exhausted from occupying themselves
  at the Honda dealership for so long.  We decided to scrap a homemade
  pizza this week and just order something when I got home.</p>
<p>I got home before Marissa and Rodney did.  I let the dogs out, then
  crawled under the blanket.  We had forgotten to turn the heat on in
  our house, so I wanted to enjoy the last few minutes of indoor mid
  sixties climate that&#8217;s just ideal for dog snuggles.</p>
<p>After Marissa and Rodney got home, we ordered Portillo&#8217;s.  I ordered
  ribs, and finished the whole slab.  That was probably the first time
  I&#8217;ve finished an entire slab of their ribs since I was in gradeschool.
  Food has a powerful way of activating memories, and wolfing down the
  tender ribs slick with buttery barbecue sauce took me back to eating
  out with my family after fall hockey games.</p>
<p>After I put Rodney to bed, Marissa and I settled in with some drinks
  and snacks.  Last night the Breaking Bad movie <i>El Camino</i> was
  released, and we were pretty excited to take us all in.  We were
  sucked in for two hours.  I probably shouldn&#8217;t have had control of the
  remote, because I kept pausing the movie every fifteen minutes.  The
  movie made me so excited that I felt like I wanted to talk about it,
  but half the time I didn&#8217;t have anything to add.  I think the works of
  Vince Gilligan have that effect on me, and that applies to the whole
  movie as well.  I loved it, and I don&#8217;t have anything to add or
  expound upon.  It&#8217;s probably better that way, I don&#8217;t want to spoil
  anything for you.  It was just absolutely perfect, and a wonderful way
  to end the work week.</p>
<p>After the movie ended and we were finished reeling about it, Marissa
  and I played some video games.  I set up Steam to work with the tv, so
  we took turns playing Super Meatboy.  &#8220;I&#8217;m so bad at this game, I feel
  like I should get my tattoo removed,&#8221; joked Marissa.  She was
  referring to our matching tattoos we have on our ankles, the one that
  everyone teasingly refers to as our Spongebob tats.  She raises a good
  question - how good to you have to be at a video game to be worthy of
  getting it tattooed on your skin?  We certainly didn&#8217;t think it
  through that much at the time.</p>
<p>Like I said, today we&#8217;re going to work outside.  Marissa and Rodney
  are getting ready for the day, and once I publish this entry, we&#8217;re
  going to empty out the shed.  We&#8217;re going to eat some leftovers for
  lunch, then I&#8217;m going to take Rodney to the grocery store and pick up
  some stuff to make deep dish pizza.  I think it&#8217;s going to be a great
  day.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great relaxing weekend.  Grab a hoodie, clean your
  garage, eat pizza, and go watch <i>El Camino</i>.</p>
