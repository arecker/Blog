<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Hope your Wednesday is working out so far.
  It&#8217;s been such a hectic week.  Yesterday our surveyor finally put a
  line down next to our house.  I stayed at home through the morning,
  and by then I was already at work.  Marissa took plenty of pictures,
  and did a really nice job drawing in lines to show the difference
  between our version of the property line, my neighbor&#8217;s version, and
  the actual property line.  The verdict turned out to be pretty fair.
  It was nothing to rub anyone&#8217;s nose in, but after checking our
  expectations and making sure we were trying to be objective, that
  wasn&#8217;t what we were looking for.  All in all, we&#8217;re happy that it&#8217;s
  done with and final.  The surveyor spray-painted a thick red line that
  connected four large wooden sticks, making it pretty unmistakable.</p>
<p>It was also a pretty busy day at work yesterday, making it challenging
  to stay on track with everyone between working with the surveyor and
  keeping our project on track.  Sometime last night while washing
  dishes, I paused to vent about the week to Marissa, who was pressing
  some paintings into wood at the dining room table.  &#8220;When is the next
  regular day going to be for us?&#8221; I complained.  It&#8217;s not like I have a
  lot to complain about.  After all, I have a day off Friday to enjoy
  some Hawks tickets that my wife surprised me with, who could complain
  about that?  I guess I&#8217;m sensitive to weird weeks like this.  Having a
  shorter work week most of the time doesn&#8217;t mean less work in the week,
  it just means a more condensed work week, and I&#8217;m feeling the burn.
  Oh, and <i>feeling the burn</i> wasn&#8217;t a veiled democratic debate
  reference.  I didn&#8217;t have time to watch any of it.  If I have time
  later, I&#8217;ll see how many highlights I can stomach, but from what I
  heard it was a bit of a circus.</p>
<p><i>Sip</i>.  Man I feel all over the place this morning.  I didn&#8217;t even
  have time to put my laundry away, which just feels wrong.  I dug into
  my clean clothes just enough to fish out a pair of underwear, like how
  you used to do things in college.</p>
<p>Yesterday after work, Marissa and I agreed that we were pretty burnt
  out from dealing with the property line, so we did something easy for
  dinner.  We went to the recycling center as a family.  Rodney took in
  the sights and the sounds while I helped Marissa overhand wood and
  plastic into the appropriate dumpsters, then we went to Hy-Vee.  We
  ate dinner in their little side restaurant, which has always been our
  go-to for dealing with stressful days.  There&#8217;s something about
  drinking a beer in a hidden corner of the grocery store, looking out
  over a forgotten corner of the parking lot.  It feels like nobody is
  going to bother you, and you&#8217;re free to just soak in the alone time
  for as long as you want before doing your shopping.</p>
<p>Marissa and Rodney split a plate of orange chicken and some fried
  rice. I had a little set of tempura shrimp sushi.  It&#8217;s dirt cheap,
  especially when the bartender decides to extend happy hour by a few
  minutes, only charging me two bucks for a tall, cold pint of
  Hoppalicious.  As we ate, we chatted more about the experience of
  getting a surveyor.</p>
<p>Today will be a pretty action packed day.  I&#8217;m trying to wrap up a
  project sometime today, I have just a few more peer reviews to write,
  and our we have a presentation to give to a visiting VP.  After work,
  we have a company happy hour thing.  The craziness of this week has me
  feeling a little shy, but Marissa is rightfully encouraging me to go
  and be social, and has graciously agreed to pinch hit for making
  dinner tonight.  I think she said something about her buffalo chicken
  casserole.  That actually sounds pretty good right now, especially
  given how many good hot sauces we have on the shelf right now.</p>
<p>To wrap up the night, we watched an hour of my movie pick, <i>The Great
  Dictator</i>.  It&#8217;s an old movie from the forties meant to lampoon
  Hitler.  Neither of us had ever seen it before, but it really hit the
  spot last night.  I felt like I identified with everyone&#8217;s anger, and
  this day and age, Hitler is everyone&#8217;s go-to evil comparison, but I
  forget that there was a time where people supported him and asking
  someone a question like &#8220;what do you think of Adolf Hitler?&#8221; may have
  been a hot button issue.  I can only imagine the hearty, righteous
  laughter coming out of the theater where this movie was first played,
  watching everyone salute an <i>Adenoid Hynkle</i> who would only allow
  artists to paint him in ten second increments and who spent all day
  fatally testing war devices.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my time, I have to catch my bus.  This felt good to write, and
  as always, thanks for reading.</p>
