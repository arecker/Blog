<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Another chilly morning, and the sun is
  starting to come up a lot later.  Waking up during the colder months
  feels so different, like I&#8217;m wandering around in a cave.  This morning
  I&#8217;m drinking &#8220;Black Cat Espresso&#8221; by Intelligentsia.  Do with that as
  you will.</p>
<p>Sip.  I had an extra five minutes before it was time to start writing,
  so while I took my first few sips of coffee I watched a random Strong
  bad email.  It was #204, or &#8221;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MujQp2NKl5U">dictionary</a>&#8221;, where somebody asks
  Strongbad if he makes his own dictionary for all his made up words.
  I&#8217;d recommend it, it&#8217;s a good one.</p>
<p>Yesterday was pretty all over the place.  It was a pretty chaotic day
  at work, hiding away to write more reviews, then scouring our project
  for things I forgot to do before moving the project to staging.  In
  the afternoon, our team had a presentation for some company executives
  that were in town visiting, then we had a work happy hour.  We met at
  some place near the square.  I was thinking about skipping it because
  I&#8217;ve had a crazy week and I was feeling pretty shy, but I decided to
  go, and I&#8217;m glad I did.  It was a good time mingling with coworkers,
  getting some drinks in, and eating off of a very pretentious
  charcuterie plate.  We all stood around trying to figure out what kind
  of pickled vegetables we were eating.  I ate something that tasted
  like an onion, but was bright neon pink, like a high lighter or pepto
  bismol.</p>
<p>Around six, I jumped on a bus.  I don&#8217;t know the later busses as well,
  and I accidentally jumped on the 4 as it was heading west.  I quickly
  jumped off around State street.  I was grateful I didn&#8217;t have to walk
  by the restaurant again where everyone was working, I&#8217;d have a
  difficult time playing that off.  Eventually I jumped on the six and
  texted Marissa.  My long time next door neighbor got on the bus right
  next to me, and because of the dim lights there was a good four or
  five seconds where we were studying each other and realizing the
  coincidence.  We chatted about how nice it is to live so close to a
  bus line, which is one of my favorite topics in the realm of bus
  smalltalk.</p>
<p>When I walked in the house, I was greeted by the wonderful smell of
  Marissa&#8217;s cooking.  I was surprised it was something other than
  buffalo chicken casserole.  She decided to try chicken tikka masala
  served with rice and warm naan bread, and from where I was sitting she
  hit it out of the park.  &#8220;I feel so useless just walking in the door
  after happy hour and sitting down at the table expecting food,&#8221; I
  joked.  It&#8217;s the truth - there&#8217;s no easy transition out of a mid week
  happy hour.  It&#8217;s like going from Friday night to Monday morning with
  absolutely no buffer in between.  One moment, you&#8217;re drinking beer
  with work friends, and within the hour there&#8217;s dinner, dishes,
  laundry, and bedtime.  The tikka masala, if anything, was my buffer.
  As we caught up around the dinner table, I could feel the spices in
  sauce take over my metabolism, making me sleepy, and it felt so good
  and comforting.  Don&#8217;t you love the way Indian food makes you feel
  right after you eat it?</p>
<p>Marissa gave Rodney a bath and I put him to bed.  Having not seen him
  all day, we dragged bedtime out for another twenty minutes or so.  I
  let Rodney try reading the book to me, then to throw him off I climbed
  into his bed and dismissed him like he had just put me to bed.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I went to the kitchen.  Marissa had already taken care of
  the dishes from dinner, but I had more Wednesday chores to do, and the
  kitchen knives were due for sharpening.  I popped in and out of the
  dining room while Marissa worked at the table trimming frames.</p>
<p>We reconvened sometime around 11 to continue watching <i>The Great
  Dictator</i>.  Didn&#8217;t quite finish it - just a measly fifteen minutes to
  go before we called it quits.  It&#8217;s only Wednesday night after all.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;m slowing waking up with coffee, sitting here in a
  comfortable hoodie grateful to reach the end of a busy week.  I have a
  day off tomorrow.  Tonight should be pretty sweet, being my early
  Friday.  I have Kids Code after work, then Marissa and I will put Rod
  to bed and watch Hot Ones.  Paul Rudd is going to be on this week, I
  would check it out if I were you.  I&#8217;m a big Paul Rudd loyalist these
  days.  If you talk to me about a movie, chance are that I&#8217;ll argue it
  would have been a better movie if he was given the lead instead.  Like
  <i>We Bought A Zoo</i>.  Paul Rudd would have killed it, let&#8217;s be honest.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great Thursday today.  Go get &#8216;em.</p>
