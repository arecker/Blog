<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Friday to you, as you&#8217;re waking up,
  getting to work, and getting ready to begin the final work day of the
  week.  As for me, I&#8217;m in my robe in full day-off mode.  The coffee
  just finished brewing, and in a few minutes after a quick entry I&#8217;m
  going to make breakfast and get everyone up.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know what we have in the fridge - I feel like I&#8217;ve been
  out of the kitchen for most of the week.  On Tuesday we ate out, on
  Wednesday I had an after work happy hour and Marissa cooked, and
  yesterday was Kid Code, so Marissa put some Portillo&#8217;s in the fridge
  for me.  But as long as we have some eggs, we&#8217;re still in business.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a great day.  Our team went out to lunch with the NOC,
  as some of their people from Manila were visiting.  We took up two
  tables comfortably in lower level of the Great Dane, talking about
  technology, computers, and podcasts.  The new Office Ladies podcast
  debuted yesterday, so that was on my mind.  &#8220;My mom wanted to watch
  it, and this was her first podcast, &#8221; I said.  &#8220;And to be honest I was
  having a hard time explaining the format to her.  Podcasts are weird.&#8221;
  The few podcast listeners at the table leaned in as we waited for our
  food.</p>
<p>Podcasts are weird.  Most of them are just flat out bad.  A flimsy
  pretense, too many ad reads, iffy production quality.  And many of the
  podcasts that are &#8220;good&#8221; are over-hyped, or have real problems with
  cult followers and gate-keeping.</p>
<p>After lunch, I finished my peer reviews, then wrapped up my project
  for the week, finally getting the code into our staging environment.
  It was a busy week, but I like getting some closure on whatever I&#8217;m
  working on.  If all went according to plan, the team will push it out
  to the rest of our staging environment today using the notes and
  modifications we made yesterday.</p>
<p>After work, I jumped on a bus and came home to Rodney and Marissa
  putting up more Halloween decorations.  Marissa was trying to angle a
  yard sign in a way that wasn&#8217;t blocked by our little figurine of a
  corgi in a bumble bee costume.  I headed inside to set down my stuff
  and unwind before KidsCode.  I had about a half hour before I needed
  to head over.  I grabbed my tech bin and wandered over to the library
  to set up for the evening session.  I didn&#8217;t have a lesson plan
  yesterday, but being so close to Halloween I decided I could just get
  away with the old &#8220;make a spooky game&#8221; stand by.  The library has a
  bin full of candy hidden in the back for us, and I knew I could
  probably leverage that as a prize for some kind of last minute
  Halloween game making contest.  We had a great time.  It was a good
  turnout with a few first timers.  One kid made a fascinating retro
  style puzzler where you cycled between characters named <i>death</i>,
  <i>fear</i>, and <i>anger</i>, each having special powers that could help you
  escape from a room.  There was another entry called <i>Trick or Treater
  Deleter</i>, which was a classic zombie survival game, only instead of
  fending off zombies, you fought of neighborhood kids from getting to
  your candy.  Another kid showed off changes he made to the Star Wars
  game he&#8217;d been working on for a few weeks, and he jokingly added a
  small floating skeleton in the corner so it would qualify for the
  contest.</p>
<p>After all the kids went home, we cleaned up the library room then
  departed for the night.  I walked in the door just as Marissa was
  about to put Rodney to bed, so I read him his bedtime story.  After
  Rodney went down for bed, I heated up my dinner and watched the new
  episode of Hot Ones with Marissa.  Paul Rudd was interviewed.  It was
  a fascinating, meandering discussion, but the real surprise was how
  well Paul Rudd handled the hot wings.  He became one of the few guests
  on the show to eat all the wings without drinking any milk or water.</p>
<p>What followed may have been the laziest evening of my life.  Marissa
  worked on some paintings while I took a shower and laid on the couch
  drifting in and out of a nap while watching King of the Hill.  It&#8217;s
  been a long week, and I needed an hour or so of power cycling.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m feeling refreshed, and looking forward to a fun day in
  Chicago.  Today we&#8217;re dropping Rodney off at grandma &amp; grandpa&#8217;s
  house, and Marissa and I are going to a Hawks game in the evening,
  doing a lot of city wandering in between.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day today.  If you&#8217;re out there beginning
  your last day of work, hang in there.  In no time, you&#8217;ll be all done,
  and you too will get to lay on the couch and power cycle while
  watching King of the Hill.  Have a great Friday.</p>
