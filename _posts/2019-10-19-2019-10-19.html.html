<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  This morning I&#8217;m coming to you from my
  parents&#8217; place in Geneva.  Yesterday after some last minute packing
  and tidying up, we hit the road sometime in the late morning.  First
  we dropped the dogs off at &#8216;summer camp&#8217;, then we made it into Geneva
  sometime in the early afternoon.  We hung around the house for about
  an hour, letting Rod get settled in, then we got dropped off at the
  train station.  There were three other people waiting at the platform
  wearing hockey jerseys.  &#8220;This must be the Blackhawks train,&#8221; laughed
  the conductor as he slid open the doors.</p>
<p>Marissa and I made our way to the top deck and sat in the back.  &#8220;Look
  at how many people are drinking White Claw,&#8221; Marissa remarked.  I
  glanced around the train, mentally counting the opened cans of White
  Claw, and sure enough it seemed like it was in the dozens.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t
  get it.  There&#8217;s barely any alcohol in them, why do people like them
  so much,&#8221; Marissa continued.  A group of young kids our age sat near
  us.  They were also drinking white claw.  &#8220;No laws when you&#8217;re on
  claws,&#8221; I mumbled under my breath, trying to get Marissa to laugh.</p>
<p>When we arrived in the city, we had about an hour before the game
  started.  The plan was to find some place to eat along the way, but as
  we got closer to the United Center we decided to just head in and find
  our seats.  Stadium junk food was starting to sound good anyway.  I
  hadn&#8217;t been to the United Center in a really long time, but back in
  the day when I was a much bigger Hawks fan, it used to be a bigger
  part of my life.  &#8220;I remember working on homework here while watching
  the games,&#8221; I reminisced.  &#8220;My dad&#8217;s work had a skybox, and when they
  weren&#8217;t using the seats to entertain a client, I would go.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a really fun energy walking around the united center.
  Marissa, expecting to feel claustrophobic and overwhelmed, noted how
  exciting it was to be around the fans, and even though there were over
  20 thousand people there, you didn&#8217;t really feel packed in.  Entering
  our section in the upper balcony, I could feel my heart skipping a
  beat seeing the lit up ice rink, house music blaring over the
  speakers.  Marissa turned to me with her jaw dropped.  After finding
  our seats, we ventured out to get some food and drinks.  We followed
  the winding hallway until Marissa stopped in her tracks.  &#8220;I smell
  nachos,&#8221; she said with the intensity of a hunter tracking a wounded
  animal.  We ordered chicken nacho grande.  Just as I was asking &#8220;is it
  going to be enough food,&#8221; the lady behind the counter handed me the
  upside down hockey helmet filled with chips, meat, and cheese.  &#8220;OH,
  alright then I think this will be enough,&#8221; I said answering my own
  question.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful game.  Chicago and Columbus were tied throughout
  the whole game, but Chicago took them in the first minute of over
  time - which was really the best of both worlds.  We got to see extra
  minutes of hockey, but it didn&#8217;t keep us there very late.</p>
<p>After the game, Marissa and I wandered around the city.  The
  excitement of the hockey game left us in a nostalgic mood.  We
  recounted our third date where I took Marissa into the city.  &#8220;Not
  only was that my first time going into the city without my family, but
  that may have been my first time going anywhere without them,&#8221;
  remembered Marissa.  &#8220;Could you imagine if I was <i>deranged</i>,&#8221; I
  laughed.  I took Marissa into the city for our third date.  She took
  the train from College Ave, and I jumped on at the Wheaton station.
  We wandered around the city all night, finishing the evening sitting
  in Millennium park.  We still debate if that would&#8217;ve been too soon
  for our first kiss, which would happen on the next date, but that was
  definitely the first time we both thought about it.</p>
<p>Marissa and I took the 11:40 train back.  We both fell asleep slumped
  over in the back of the train.  My head shot up at 12:40, and I
  hurriedly dug out my phone to check where we were.  Marissa&#8217;s phone
  alarm went off.  &#8220;Perfect timing,&#8221; she said.  We waited for an Uber
  from the train station back to my parents place.  For a few minutes,
  we could here coyotes screaming in the distance, and they suddenly
  stopped.  Marissa and I bided our time by trying to howl back at them.
  After about fifteen minutes, our Uber arrived.  &#8220;You know I just came
  from the United Center, ya&#8217;ll should have just ridden with me,&#8221; he
  laughed.  At least we got in a good nap on the train.</p>
<p>When we got home, we heated up a plate of Aurelio&#8217;s pizza before
  sailing off to bed.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re about to pack the car and head home.  Our evening
  hanging out with Grandpa and Grandma, walking around in the city, and
  watching the Blackhawks play was the perfect ending to a busy week.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and hope you have a relaxing weekend too.</p>
