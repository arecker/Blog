<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re feeling good this Monday morning.
  It&#8217;s dark, dreary, and looking at the forecast I might have to walk to
  the bust stop through a misting of rain, but that&#8217;s actually sounding
  pretty refreshing right now.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day - nothing to write home about, but it
  felt like a very typical day, and after spending so much of this
  weekend traveling and going to places, it was a much needed return to
  average.  We all ate breakfast at the table, then left ran some
  errands as a family.  We first went to Home Depot to pick up some
  supplies, which included wood for the new shelves in the IT corner.
  We grabbed a quick lunch at Portillo&#8217;s, then swung by Hy-Vee to pick
  up food.  We put Rodney down for a nap, then Marissa worked in the
  basement while I watched the Bears game.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just going to be brave here.  The Bears played pretty poorly.
  It&#8217;s starting to look like a very unfortunate year to jump on the
  Bears bandwagon, but we&#8217;re here now, and this is our team.  Their
  performance was pretty underwhelming, especially considering they&#8217;ve
  had an entire two weeks off since getting pummeled by the Raiders in
  London.  I was pretty hopeful, I thought they would figure things out,
  and just the shear fact that we got our starting QB back would get
  everyone fired up.  Mitch was back, but he missed some frustratingly
  easy throws.  Our offense was in shambles, and by the third quarter
  our defense matched.  It was still fun to watch the game, but I really
  hope the Bears try something new before next Sunday.  At this point
  they have little to lose.</p>
<p>As the game started to wind down, I fired up the grill to cook some
  burgers.  As Marissa was working in the basement, I could hear her
  yelling at the TV, so in a sense I felt like I was still following the
  action, even while working outside.  I plated up dinner, which was
  just some regular Hy-Vee burgers, baked beans, and potato chips.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just going to be brave here.  My burgers didn&#8217;t turn out great.  I
  don&#8217;t know how I managed to screw up cheeseburgers, but it&#8217;s humbling,
  and it will make you stand back and evaluate things.  I&#8217;m still not
  sure what happened.  I used the pre-formed patties that come in an
  eight pack.  I seasoned them, seared them on each side for about a
  minute, then finished them over indirect heat.  If anything, I thought
  I left the burgers on for too long, since I had to help Rodney use the
  potty around the time I&#8217;d normally take them out, but a few of the
  patties had red inside of them.  It was like they were somehow
  overcooked and undercooked at the same time.  &#8220;It&#8217;s like someone slid
  a shard of frozen beef into the center of these, like a splinter -
  just to mess with me,&#8221; I joked.</p>
<p>Following my lead, we also together chided my lapse in judgment in
  getting chips as a side dish.  &#8220;Yeah, chips aren&#8217;t a side,&#8221; Marissa
  laughed.  &#8220;Now I&#8217;m really thirsty, like I feel like I need to drink a
  gallon of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to stand back and laugh.  This past year has been a cooking
  Renaissance for me.  I&#8217;ve learned lots of new recipes, but I still
  grill the same way.  To borrow from Mitch Trubisky&#8217;s words after last
  night&#8217;s horrible game, &#8220;Our offense has no identity.  We&#8217;re just
  searching.&#8221;  Same for my grilling game, Mitch.</p>
<p>After dinner, I knocked out my Sunday chores, caught up on some
  emails, then edited a timelapse together for Marissa.  After selecting
  a song from my playlist, I finally took the time to read up on
  Instagram&#8217;s rules with copyrighted music, and I was very disappointed
  to learn how restrictive it is.  &#8220;When in doubt, you should not post
  content that you didn&#8217;t create, including music,&#8221; read the FAQ on
  their support site.  We&#8217;ve gotten away with it thus far, and when a
  video of hers has gotten flagged it&#8217;s pretty simple to re export it
  without the audio and resubmit it, but Marissa just hit 100K followers
  over the weekend and I was suddenly feeling wary about pushing our
  luck with such an investment.</p>
<p>You can still use royalty free music, so you&#8217;re free to make your
  video sound like an iPhone commercial or a crummy soundcloud rapper
  promo.  &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll have to start making music,&#8221; Marissa joked.
  She reminded me that at one point I talked about getting a small drum
  machine like the one Kanye keeps in a small shiny suitcase.  It&#8217;s
  still possible I guess.  She should consider the seed planted.</p>
<p>Marissa worked up until bedtime while I wound down the night with some
  King of the Hill.  The dogs both snuggled on the couch with me while I
  drank a beer.  I watched the episode where Bobby starts to express
  interest in football and Hank plans the perfect football outing to
  seal the deal and they get into lots of trouble.</p>
<p>Today, back to work, and back to a regular week.  Marissa is planning
  on releasing a bunch of paintings at the end of the week, and last
  night we were kicking around the idea of going bowling on Friday to
  celebrate.  We think Rodney is old enough - if not old enough to roll
  a ball, he&#8217;s certainly old enough to appreciate the bowling alley
  vibe.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Thanks for reading, and I&#8217;ll
  see you in the next entry.</p>
