<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing well today.  This morning
  I&#8217;m taking my time winding up for the morning, enjoying the coffee.
  Black Cat Espresso was a hit with Marissa, so I bought another bag,
  and I think I finally figured out how to brew it well.  I just had to
  use slightly more beans than I would for any other coffee - that seems
  to have pushed it over the edge and made it a great cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a great day.  Leaving the house after ranting about
  Marissa&#8217;s infamous salad put me in a great mood.  It didn&#8217;t rain
  nearly as much as I expected, so wearing just a rain pancho, I was
  starting to regret my outfit choice.  Yesterday, I was dressed for
  Monday&#8217;s weather, and on Monday I was dressed for yesterday&#8217;s
  weather - if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Dressing for climate is hard, isn&#8217;t it?  Especially if you live in the
  Midwest.  I wish I could just wear the same thing every day, but you
  have to live somewhere really temperate to do that, don&#8217;t you?  I&#8217;d
  like to see Steve Jobs wear one of his black turtlenecks and weird
  jeans in Madison in the summer.  Or in Madison during the winter.  A
  thin black turtleneck would be a poor choice for both.  If you wear
  the same thing every day, you&#8217;re not a genius.  The way I see it, you
  either live in California, or you&#8217;re an idiot.</p>
<p>I had a much more normal day of work.  After morning stand-up, my
  coworker brewed some Chinese green tea for us all to try.  I didn&#8217;t
  mind sacrificing a cup of coffee - it&#8217;s all just caffeine anyway.  We
  stood in the kitchen watching her skillfully steep the tea leaves in
  hot water, decanting it into our coffee stained mugs.</p>
<p>For lunch, I heated up my hutspot.  I had been thinking about it all
  morning, especially since I was under-dressed for the cold.  I also
  brought a saucijzenbroodje, cramming it into the tupperware between
  the cabbage and the lid.  On Monday, I was running behind on dinner,
  so rather than crimping the remaining meat into a neat little log, I
  just flopped it down in the middle of some puff pastry and pinched it
  closed - like some kind of weird Dutch ravioli.  But puff pastry looks
  gorgeous after you bake it, no matter what shape it&#8217;s in, and the lazy
  meat pastry monstrosity looked like a very thoughtful variation of a
  sausage roll.</p>
<p>I slinked away to the seventh floor eating area with my lunch and my
  laptop.  Sometime that day, we would get the official map from the
  surveyor so we could mail a copy to my neighbor, and I wanted to write
  a cover letter.  I wasn&#8217;t looking to stoke anything new.  It was just
  a courteous little bow to tie on this crummy property line dispute,
  and hopefully conclude it.  I think perhaps in a parallel universe,
  I&#8217;m making a living writing legal documents for people, if that job
  even exists.  Sometimes I get carried away with flowery <i>legaleze</i>,
  but I have just as much of a right to be an armchair lawyer as anyone
  else, don&#8217;t I?  When I was done, I sent the letter to Marissa for
  review.  I made sure to include my usual wildly inappropriate and
  outlandish &#8220;PS&#8221; section where I end the letter in the worst way
  possible.  I couldn&#8217;t help myself.  I made sure to delete my joke
  postscript before Marissa could print it.</p>
<p>As I got onto the bus, I got a message from Marissa warning me that
  Rod was in a pretty bad mood.  &#8220;No problem,&#8221; I responded.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll
  screw around at Hy-Vee for a bit, then I&#8217;ll try to keep him in the
  kitchen.&#8221;  Whatever had been bothering him all day must have worn off
  after a good nap.  He was still sleeping when I got home, and was
  pretty agreeable as I woke him up, got his socks on, and put him in
  the car.</p>
<p>I try to chat with Rodney when we drive to the grocery store.  I can
  usually hold his attention for a few seconds before he sees an
  ambulance or an excavator, and acknowledging those as we drive by
  takes precedence over small talk.  &#8220;How was your day today, dude?&#8221; I
  asked from the front seat, turning down the music.  &#8220;Vriblllrblrrib
  glib sfffverlish bita&#8230; Mama mad.  Mama mad,&#8221; Rodney replied.
  Rodney&#8217;s a good talker, but at this stage he has to warm up each
  sentence with a few syllables of babbling, which we&#8217;ve started doing
  ourselves too - I think everyone should try talking that way.  &#8220;Yeah?
  I heard you guys had some problems today&#8230;&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;DADA.  LOOK.
  EXCAVATOR,&#8221; yelled Rodney.  And at that, small talk with Dad
  concluded.</p>
<p>We picked up ingredients for cream of chicken and wild rice soup.  We
  were moving quickly, having lost a lot of time in traffic.  Rod picked
  up on my urgency and remained helpful.  I ripped off a piece of bread
  for him, and he sat on the bottom lip of the cart and nibbled on it
  contently.  Just before we pulled into a checkout lane, we decided to
  swing by the flowers and pick some up for Mom.  &#8220;I know you probably
  already said &#8216;sorry&#8217;, dude, but sometimes some surprise flowers can
  help smooth things over,&#8221; I explained.  I was speaking from
  experience.</p>
<p>Rodney proudly presented the flowers to Mom while I unpacked the
  groceries and prepped for dinner.  &#8220;Rodney is out of the doghouse,&#8221; we
  joked.  Marissa went back downstairs to work, and Rodney and I got to
  making dinner.  We chopped the veggies together at the counter, then
  he got bored and asked if he could watch Blippi.  &#8220;Sure, dude - I have
  to cut the chicken now anyway,&#8221; I replied.  And there&#8217;s no good way to
  tag team slicing chicken thighs with a toddler.  That has to be among
  the top five worst learning activities.  Rodney plopped on the couch
  with his juice, I hit shuffle on our 100 hours of saved Blippi
  episodes, and I returned to making dinner.</p>
<p>As we ate, we talked about anger.  It seemed like it was on everyone&#8217;s
  mind - mouthing off to mom during a morning dog agility outing, or
  stewing about a crummy interaction with a neighbor that dredged up
  some dormant bitterness.</p>
<p>After dinner, I watched a final episode of Blippi with Rodney on the
  couch, then put him to bed.  Lately his favorite book to read is this
  very flimsy &#8220;spot the animal&#8221; book.  It only has six pages.  For all
  the filibustering he does to prolong bedtime - tucking in each stuffed
  animal and trying to draw my attention to the window - you&#8217;d think he
  would pick a longer book, right?</p>
<p>I cleaned the kitchen while Marissa continued to work downstairs.  We
  reconvened on the couch around 11:30, having just enough time to
  finish Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Watching Indiana Jones has been such
  a delight.  For the last few days, Marissa and I have been swept away
  by how cool this movie is, and we sheepishly admitted to each other
  that we&#8217;ve never actually seen it.  &#8220;I convinced myself that I&#8217;ve seen
  it, but I think I&#8217;ve only watched the scene at the end where
  everyone&#8217;s head explodes,&#8221; I explained.  Alert the newspapers - the
  Recker family approves of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>.</p>
<p>It was midnight, and we didn&#8217;t feel like going to bed just yet.  I was
  showing Marissa some movies I added to our plex server, and one of
  them was &#8220;The Last Kiss&#8221; with Zach Braff and Rachel Bilson.  &#8220;Why did
  you get this,&#8221; Marissa asked.  &#8220;It was filmed in Madison,&#8221; I eagerly
  explained.  &#8220;It was set there too, I think they&#8217;re both supposed to be
  UW students, and I heard there are lots of shots of the city.&#8221;  I
  thought it would be fun to watch pretentious celebrities pretend to be
  humble Madisonians like us.  We watched twenty minutes of the movie,
  and while it opened with a nice pan from our great capital building to
  a familiar Wisconsin license plate, the remaining twenty minutes we
  watched was disgusting.  Really bad - even for Zach Braff.  I paused
  the movie, looking at the elapsed time in horror.  &#8220;This is going to
  be a long one.  Buckle in.&#8221;  Our rules dictate that once we start
  watching a movie we own, we have to finish it.  Marissa reminded me
  that <i>Hitch</i> was my idea too.</p>
<p>The big question is - will it be worse than <i>Hitch</i>?</p>
