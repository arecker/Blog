<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Thursday to you.  And to my mother who
  is probably reading this thirty seconds after it was published, happy
  birthday Mom!  The first thing on my to-do list this morning when I
  get into work is to write you a birthday email, so expect that soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday was one of those days where I didn&#8217;t leave my house all day.
  In the afternoon, I worked a bit sitting on the deck, but it doesn&#8217;t
  count unless I left my backyard.  I didn&#8217;t even make it as far as the
  driveway.  I usually work from home on Wednesdays, but we didn&#8217;t go
  out to eat for lunch and I didn&#8217;t need to go to the grocery store
  either, so this definitely was a special case.</p>
<p>Rod woke up with about an hour after me.  Marissa stirred, but I told
  her to go back to bed and offered to get him ready for the morning.
  Marissa has been staying up late trying to finish her paintings before
  the end of the week, and I knew she could use the extra hour or so of
  sleep.  I worked on the couch while Rod watched Blippi.  Sometime
  around 9:30 he ran up to me with his wooden recorder and offered to go
  upstairs and use it to wake Momma up.  I laughed, because in that
  moment I couldn&#8217;t think of a worse way to wake up.  The little devil
  over my shoulder wanted me to let him - she would go back to sleep and
  laugh about it later, right?  But better sensibilities prevailed.</p>
<p>Around 11, I took a break and heated up some lunch.  I had some
  leftover hutspot and a saucijzenbroodje.  I also had a beer.  I&#8217;m
  conditioned to expect a beer during Wednesday lunch, whether we go out
  to eat or not.</p>
<p>I finished up the workday, then sometime around four Marissa and I had
  a quick sync-up to plan the night.  We wanted to make sfincione, and
  since we were planning on making it last week we still had all the
  ingredients around.  &#8220;I just need a yellow onion, so as dumb as it
  sounds we&#8217;ll need to swing by Hy-Vee&#8230;,&#8221; I cut myself short while I
  was rifling around the kitchen looking for ingredients.  I spotted a
  perfect yellow onion hiding under our bananans.  &#8220;AH!  Nevermind,
  somehow we have an onion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa took Rod to Home Depot to pick up some supplies, and I fired
  up a podcast and started making the sfincione.  Usually, we hurriedly
  make this pizza on Friday night after I get home from work.  I forgot
  how relaxing it was to mix the sticky, sweet dough, simmer the sauce,
  and grate cheese in the kitchen.  I kicked off a podcast, then got to
  work, getting the pristine pizza in the oven exactly when Marissa and
  Rodney pulled in the driveway.</p>
<p>We had just added the new Lion King movie to plex, and since today was
  such a cozy home day, I suggested we eat pizza on the couch while
  watching it.  Rod wanted to watch Blippi, so there was some family
  drama, but soon enough we were all grazing on fresh pizza watching the
  movie.  We had seen it once in the theater, and the second time around
  seeing it in our own home we felt the freedom to be more critical.
  &#8220;Is it just me or does Mufasa sound less natural?&#8221; Marissa asked out
  loud.  &#8220;Definitely, &#8221; I agreed.  &#8220;He has a great voice, but it sounds
  like a monologue, even when he&#8217;s talking to Simba.&#8221;  The movie
  continued on to the more well known musical numbers.  I pointed out
  that during the famous &#8220;Ain&#8217;t no worries&#8221; interlude, Donald Glover
  doesn&#8217;t sing the melody straight.  Which is fine, but it bothered me
  that he even riffed on the first line when older Simba emerges from
  the bushes.  They also really make a meal out of the Timon and Pumba
  dialog.  It felt like a Seth Rogan buddy comedy was laced throughout
  the whole song.</p>
<p>We paused the Lion King so I could put Rodney to bed.  Marissa and I
  stood on the deck for a few minutes watching the rain, then I did my
  Wednesday chores while she worked in the basement.  Before Marissa
  went downstairs, she hinted that she would be in the mood for
  quasadillas later that night.  Message received loud and clear, wife.
  Around 11, knowing she&#8217;d be coming upstairs any minute, I fried some
  cheese quesadillas in cast iron.  We were out of Mexican cheese, so I
  had to make one of them with Mozzarella.  I&#8217;ve always teased my wife
  about how bad she is at differentiating which cheese is appropriate to
  use for the given meal (e.g. mozzarella on Italian, Monterey on
  tacos), so I joked that it was the great cheese tasting challenge.
  &#8220;One of these quesadillas is appropriate for the theme - the other is
  an imposter,&#8221; I laughed.</p>
<p>After our late night snack, we watched a little more of Zach Braff&#8217;s
  boring self-centered loosely Madison based soap opera.  I&#8217;m talking of
  course about the movie <i>The Last Kiss</i>.  We watched what felt like an
  hour, but pausing the movie at midnight, Marissa threw a pillow at my
  head seeing we had 55 minutes to go.  The movie is definitely worse
  than <i>Hitch</i>.  At least it&#8217;s &#8216;soap opera&#8217; bad.  It&#8217;s very sad and
  infuriating, but I have a feeling that it&#8217;s going to get so bad it
  will take us out of it and the rest will be easier to watch.  The
  Madison Wisconsin references are at an all time low.  At one point,
  Sarah Bilson asked Zach Braff to meat her at the terrace, and we
  recognized those weird colorful chairs they had set down by the water.
  But if that and the capital are the only part of our home we&#8217;ll
  recognize this movie, it was <i>not</i> worth it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my time.  Have a great day, everyone.  If you see my mother
  around, wish her a happy birthday.</p>
