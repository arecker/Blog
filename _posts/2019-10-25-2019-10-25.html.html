<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  And happy Friday.  This morning with my
  morning coffee I went on a little photo editing adventure.  When my
  phone alarm went off this morning, there was a little sticky note
  attached to it telling me to check slack.  I sleepily unlocked my
  phone and saw a message from my wife at 3:42 AM saying she had some
  trouble getting the photos off of her new camera and exporting them to
  the right format.  I trudged downstairs in my robe, let the dogs out,
  and poured some coffee.  As I carefully manipulated her new camera
  under the light of my phone&#8217;s flashlight, I couldn&#8217;t help but admire
  how sturdy and well-made it is.  Finding the SD card bay was a much
  more pleasant experience than it was on the GOPRO we used to use for
  this.</p>
<p>I popped open the slot - empty.  Picking my phone up off the window
  sill for light, I searched the computer work station for the SD card.
  It was lying next to the Intel NUC on the desk, plugged into an SD
  card adapter.  &#8220;Ah, evidence of a struggle&#8230; with technology,&#8221; I
  muttered to myself, doing the best impression of a crime scene
  investigator I could.</p>
<p>I removed the micro SD card from the SD card adapter.  It felt so
  light at the end of my finger, like a little piece of cilantro.  As a
  side note, I&#8217;m not a fan with how everything is switching over to the
  &#8220;micro&#8221; version of what it was already doing.  Micro USB.  Micro
  HDMI.  Micro SD.  Enough already.</p>
<p>I slid the tiny card delicately into the side of the NUC.  I could
  feel the spring retract, then emit a very satisfying <i>ka-KLINK</i>.  The
  file manager program detected the new device and opened on the
  desktop.  It took some clicking around to find where the pictures were
  actually stored.  I was especially puzzled to still see a folder
  called &#8220;100GOPRO&#8221;.  Either we forgot to wipe the SD card before using
  it in her new camera, or Canon&#8217;s camera is smart enough to leave
  everything alone.  Inside were over 500 CR2 files - the ones that were
  giving Marissa trouble last night.  I copied all the files to the
  desktop.  While waiting, I took a moment to appreciate how defeated
  she must have felt last night.  When I went to bed, she told me she
  was hoping to get all the photos of her new paintings on her website
  before morning.  I can imagine the frustration and doubt, wondering if
  the camera was set up correctly and if she would have to spend time
  taking pictures all over again.</p>
<p>I went to the internet, searching for &#8220;converting CR2 on linux&#8221;.  The
  first result was from stack exchange.  There was a program called
  &#8220;ufraw-batch&#8221; that could do the file conversion right at the terminal.
  I ran the program.  It slurped in the first photo and hung for about
  two minutes.  Suddenly ufraw-batch didn&#8217;t feel like a silver bullet
  anymore.  The program crashed, spitting the dreaded words
  &#8220;segmentation fault&#8221; to the terminal before dying.  Well that&#8217;s not a
  good sign.  I punched &#8220;ufraw-batch segmen&#8221; into the search bar.
  Google happily supplied the rest - &#8220;segmentation fault&#8221;.  There was an
  open bug filed for ufraw-batch on ubuntu 18.04 titled &#8220;ufraw-batch
  crashes with segmentation fault&#8221;.  I scrolled to the bottom, scanning
  the comments for workarounds or solutions.  Nothing.  Back to google.</p>
<p>I found the original stack exchange post that lead me to the program.
  In the comments, somebody noted the fatal bug in Ubuntu - that would
  have saved me some time.  There was another suggestion underneath to
  use a program called &#8220;mogrify&#8221;.  Mysteriously, it was already
  installed on our computer.  Had Marissa tried this before?  Was she
  secretly a computer genius?  Ah, I see now, it&#8217;s embedded in the
  standard &#8220;imagemagick&#8221; program.  That&#8217;s convenient, but not nearly as
  exciting as Marissa having a secret expertise.</p>
<p>I ran the program in the terminal.  It processed the files quickly,
  spitting out PNG files right next to the original CR2s.  I double
  clicked one of them while the program was working.  The lighting
  looked better - it was no longer dark and shadowy like the CR2s, but
  this version was almost too white.  It looked like it was washed out.
  I knew that would never do.</p>
<p>I cancelled the program and did some quick reading about CR2s.  I
  learned that for one, it was called &#8220;cannon raw format&#8221;.  I broadened
  my search, looking for raw image editors for linux.  My hope was that
  if I couldn&#8217;t export the photos to something, at least I could kick
  the tires on a new editing program and let Marissa fight it out all
  morning.  Not ideal, but the photos would still make it to her
  website.  I stumbled upon &#8220;darktable&#8221;.</p>
<p>I flipped over to a terminal and installed it.  It opened right away,
  but instead of the typical gross, practical looking linux software it
  actually looked pretty sexy.  Nice font, jet black buttons, and very
  intuitive.  Scanning over the options, I imported the CR2s.  I was
  pleased to see the thumbnails were rendered in natural color.  It must
  know what it&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>As I was searching for some basic editing functions, I came across an
  export menu.  &#8220;Export to JPEG.&#8221;  That looks good.  A few clicks later,
  and light table was cranking through the photos, dumping them into a
  new folder I created.  I double clicked the first.  It was a picture
  of Ollie, looking wise and graceful, in full light and natural color.
  Success!  I jumped in the shower while they finished converting.</p>
<p>This morning while writing this, I&#8217;m uploading all the photos to
  Marissa&#8217;s Google account.  Don&#8217;t worry honey, the photos look great,
  and it&#8217;s already on 295 out of 595, so they should be ready to rock
  when you wake up.  Just in case you need the originals, they&#8217;re on
  the desktop in a folder called JPEGS.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Keep an eye on
  astuaryart.com - my wife has a whole bunch of paintings she&#8217;s
  releasing today.</p>
