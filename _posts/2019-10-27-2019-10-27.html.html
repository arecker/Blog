<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Sunday, especially to those who also
  decided to sleep in.  I feel like I&#8217;ve been sleeping extra hours all
  weekend, waking up around 8:30 yesterday and pushing into the 9 range
  this morning.  I must be subconsciously priming my body to deal with
  daylight savings time.  By the way, our clocks go back one hour
  exactly one week from now, so look alive out there.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty wonderful day.  Marissa was at an agility trial
  all day with Ziggy, to the Rod, Ollie, and I held down the fort all
  day.  We heated up some leftovers for lunch, walked to the grocery
  store, then cooked our first butternut squash soup.  I was pretty
  blown away at how easy it was, especially considering how strange the
  squash is to work with.  It was also very perilous to cut into, and I
  was grateful I had a sharp knife and things went smoothly.  After the
  squash was halfed, it went into a roasting pan with some onions and
  carrots.  It was fun to take out the roasting pan again - the last
  time I had seen it was while making a ham for easter.  While the
  vegetables were roasting, I made bacon bits, and then just for kicks I
  also cooked some cashews in butter and rosemary.  The smell of toasted
  nuts, herb butter, crispy bacon, and simmering soup filled the house
  when Marissa got home in the evening, and I was at peak fall-themed
  cooking snobbery.  In fact, just for extra points I made sure the
  <i>Fall</i> EP by Jon Foreman was playing when we sat down to eat.</p>
<p>After dinner, Marissa put Rod to bed, then we finished watching
  Marissa&#8217;s pick, the temple of doom.  While it was a far better choice
  than our last movie, <i>The Last Kiss</i>, the <i>Temple of Doom</i> was really
  stressful to watch.  It was like they fit three Indiana Jones movies
  into one, making it as dense with action as they could.  &#8220;This movie
  is like a coked out version of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>,&#8221; I
  complained.  &#8220;That&#8217;s very possible, this came out in the 80&#8217;s.
  Everyone was probably doing coke,&#8221; Marissa added.  &#8220;Look at how much
  is happening on the screen!&#8221; I yelled.  &#8220;How could you possibly even
  summarize what happened in this movie?  It&#8217;s non-stop problems &amp;
  anxiety.  This movie is basically the <i>Polar Express</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>After the movie, we took a short quesadilla break to let our heart
  rates drop back down to normal.  Marissa and I chit chatted in the
  kitchen while we waited for the cast iron skillet to heat.  I rifled
  through our cabinet, carefully selecting three or four hot sauces I
  wanted to sample with my quesadilla.  &#8220;We don&#8217;t have any good plates
  to sample hot sauce with,&#8221; I griped.  Marissa laughed, &#8220;What exactly
  are you looking for?&#8221;  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I whined.  &#8220;I like to taste
  just a few drops from each, but I don&#8217;t want them to mix together.&#8221;
  Marissa flashed a smile and flew down the stairs into the basement.  A
  few moments later she returned, holding a plastic paint pallet.  &#8220;This
  would be perfect.  I used to use these for water color, but I don&#8217;t do
  that as much anymore.  You can have this one.&#8221;  The idea was
  hilarious, but so perfect and practical.  I added a few drops of hot
  sauce in each little dimple and stacked a few wedges of quesadilla in
  the middle.  &#8220;This is genius,&#8221; I declared.  I was like the Bob Ross of
  hot sauces.</p>
<p>We settled in on the couch again and watched some of Paul Rudd&#8217;s new
  show, <i>Living with Yourself</i>.  We have one episode left, but as long
  as the stick the ending, it&#8217;s already one of our favorite shows.  I&#8217;ve
  said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again now - everything Paul Rudd
  touches is gold.  If anything, this show has taught me that there was
  room for improvement in <i>every</i> Paul Rudd movie or tv show - he could
  have been playing <i>two</i> parts instead of only one.</p>
<p>This morning, Marissa is getting ready for another agility trial this
  morning.  Rodney and I are hoping to shower, go grocery shopping, and
  return in time to watch the Bears game at noon.  Between breaks and
  after the game, we&#8217;re going to make some pizza.  Rodney also wants to
  go to the park.  His stuffed giraffe has a cough, and he thinks the
  fresh air would be good for him.  If you think about it, having a
  kneck that big, there&#8217;s probably a lot that can go wrong, and a
  giraffe sized soar throat must be pretty painful.  If you are friends
  with Baby Giraffe on Facebook or LinkedIn, please send along your best
  wishes, this is a tough one.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Watch the Bears Game, eat
  pizza, and take care of the stuffed baby giraffe in your family.</p>
