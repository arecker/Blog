excerpt: groceries, bears, and pizza

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Monday.  I&#8217;m feeling very rested this
  morning.  Marissa and I went to bed at a pretty decent time, and on
  top of that, I spent most of this weekend on the couch.  As a result,
  I&#8217;m looking forward to getting back to work this morning.</p>
<p>Yesterday was pretty much a repeat of Saturday.  We all slept in, I
  cooked breakfast, then Rodney and I walked to the grocery store to
  pick up dinner.  Since there was a Bears game that day, we both wore
  our hoodies.  A few cars honked at us walking along Atwood.  I&#8217;d like
  to think it was a friendly honk.  We only needed a few things at the
  store, so we were in and out of there pretty quick.  We walked briskly
  down the bike path, trying to make it in time for kick-off.  We were
  stopped by a small baby that wanted to see Rodney&#8217;s car stroller.
  &#8220;Nice ride!&#8221; the mom yelled.  &#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s not too many days left
  where we can take out the convertible,&#8221; I joked.  I didn&#8217;t come up
  with that one on the spot, that&#8217;s just my go-to.  Standing around
  other parents while our kids interact can get awkward, and that&#8217;s no
  time to try out <i>new</i> jokes.</p>
<p>We got home just a few minutes after kick-off.  I turned the game on
  the TV and grabbed a beer out of the fridge.  Rodney dumped his lego&#8217;s
  on the ground in front of the TV.  Marissa was on her way out of the
  house with the dogs.  &#8220;Good luck, Ziggy,&#8221; we yelled as the door closed
  behind her.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s game was pretty rough.  Our offense still wasn&#8217;t clicking,
  and even though we had several drives into the red zone it felt like
  we still just couldn&#8217;t score.  And Eddie Pineiro missed a game winning
  field goal.  That one really hurt to watch.  I guess as a kicker, game
  winning situations don&#8217;t find you very often, and perhaps after he won
  the game for us in Denver I may have had him on a bit of a pedestal,
  but part of me is glad he missed that kick, because we didn&#8217;t deserve
  a win.  Marissa and I watched some post game interviews when she got
  home.  Normally I just blow right past those, but Nagy made a lot of
  calls that were under fire, and it made for an interesting Q&amp;A time.
  He even got a little heated.  Nagy was mostly getting blasted for
  taking a knee with almost a minute to go, leaving it up to Eddie
  (instead of running one more play and getting closer to the goal
  line)..  I hate to say it, but he made the right call.  You can knock
  him all you want for not having any faith in our offense, but I didn&#8217;t
  have any faith in them either, and the ball was spotted well within
  Eddie&#8217;s scoring range.</p>
<p>Last night as we were eating dinner, we got into an &#8216;argument&#8217; with
  Rodney over what animal was on his Bears hoodie.  &#8220;Tiger,&#8221; he stated,
  pointing at the orange Bears logo.  &#8220;What animal is that?&#8221; Marissa
  questioned.  &#8220;Tiger,&#8221; replied Rodney.  I decided to take a crack at
  it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey dude, what game did we watch today?&#8221;  I asked.  &#8220;Bears game,&#8221;
  Rodney said.  &#8220;And you&#8217;re wearing your Bears hoodie, right?&#8221;  Rodney
  nodded.  &#8220;Bears hoodie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What animal is that?&#8221; I asked.  &#8220;Tiger,&#8221; replied Rodney.  &#8220;Well,
  tigers are usually orange,&#8221; Marissa added.</p>
<p>After dinner, Marissa put Rodney to bed and I cleaned up after dinner.
  We made deep dish pizza, and packing deep dish leftovers is always
  kind of a riddle, and I have yet to solve it.  The best I&#8217;ve come up
  with is cutting individual slices after it&#8217;s cooled, arranging the
  slices opposite and adjacent to each other forming a parallelogram,
  then wrapping the whole mess in a glob of foil.  I try to even crimp
  the foil around the crust so the pizza keeps its shape, then slip the
  whole mess into a plastic bag.  It works, but I&#8217;m always a little
  ashamed keeping my wad of plastic and tinfoil in the fridge at work
  when there is so much pressure around recycling and keeping a small
  waste footprint.</p>
<p>On a high note with regards to storing deep dish leftovers, I invented
  a new way to cut the pizza.  I used to saw the slices, which would
  crack the delicate crust and sometimes even snap it off, but last
  night I got my biggest, sharpest knife, put the pizza in the middle of
  the cutting board, and chopped it in a swift motion.  The slice
  separated cleaning, crust in tact.  &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s you just gotta &#8216;fruit
  ninja&#8217; it,&#8221; I laughed.</p>
<p>Marissa and I finished watching <i>Living with Yourself</i>, then we tidied
  up the house for an hour or so.  We finished the night by watching my
  movie pick <i>Back to School</i>.  It&#8217;s part of the series of movies I&#8217;ve
  found that were filmed in Madison.  We&#8217;re only about a third into it,
  but this light-hearted Rodney Dangerfield comedy is hitting the spot.
  In the movie, UW Madison is renamed &#8220;Great Lakes College&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my time.  I have to head outside and catch a bus.  Hope you
  have a great Monday, and don&#8217;t forget that Halloween is coming up this
  week!</p>
