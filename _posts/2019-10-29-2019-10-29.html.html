<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re having a great Tuesday, wherever
  you are.  Where I&#8217;m at now, it&#8217;s 7:29 AM, and there&#8217;s a bit of snow on
  the ground - which is exciting, because it feels like with all the
  extra light bouncing around the morning is just a little brigther.</p>
<p>This morning I have a lot of things rolling around in my head.
  Yesterday wasn&#8217;t really that recap worthy.  I took Rodney to the
  grocery store, came home, then made some hashbrowns with tilapia
  cooked over onions.  I grated the potatoes with a cheese grater and
  wrung out all the water with cheese cloth, then cooked them in hot
  cast iron.  They were a little too salty, but I was just grateful that
  they browned and actually formed a little patty.  Before and during
  dinner was a little rough - Rodney had kind of a bad behavior day, and
  Marissa and I are still a little exhausted from dealing with it, and
  it just doesn&#8217;t feel right to make light of it.  Putting him to bed
  last night, we ended things on a high note, and if all goes according
  to plan we&#8217;ll be back to goofing around in the grocery store, cooking
  dinner, and making jokes around the dinner table.</p>
<p>Another topic that is rolling around in my head this morning is
  typos.  These journal entries I make every morning usually have one or
  two mistakes.  Sometimes when I have trouble focusing or waking up, I
  publish an entry with about a dozen mistakes.  Typos make things hard
  to read, and I avoid them.  Usually, after running the publishing
  script and walking over to the bus stop, the first thing I do is read
  the entry.  Yesterday, I cringed at how many errors were in my post.
  One or two doesn&#8217;t bother me, but if it gets to the point where it
  hinders what I&#8217;m trying to get across, that&#8217;s a problem for me.</p>
<p>You might ask, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you just proofread it?&#8221;  I try to.  I used
  to write for twenty minutes in the morning, get about 800 words, then
  I&#8217;d take about 10 minutes to edit it down.  I tend to write too many
  words, so the final product would be around 700 words.  These days,
  the more I write, the more comfortable I feel filling 1000, so much so
  that 700-800 just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Eventually I chose
  to just sacrifice the last few minutes of proof reading for the sake
  of writing more.  Writing clears my head, it feels good, and while I
  try not to leave any typos, I don&#8217;t want to sacrifice extra time in
  the morning.</p>
<p>I also feel the need to point out that a typo isn&#8217;t a lack of
  understanding.  Typo&#8217;s are a mechanical failure.  Even though I might
  type &#8220;though&#8221; instead of &#8220;thought&#8221;, or &#8220;your&#8221; instead of &#8220;you&#8217;re&#8221;, I
  know which word you&#8217;re supposed to use.  I know my grammar, and unless
  you bring an eight grade grammar book over and challenge me to a
  shootout, you&#8217;ll just have to trust me.  I&#8217;m one of the only adults I
  know that can still diagram sentences.  I care about grammar.  It&#8217;s
  part of the way I think.</p>
<p>Just wanted to throw that out there.  To sum up, I&#8217;m aware that I
  leave typos behind.  This is a very personal medium, which is why I
  choose quantity over quality.  I assure you the typos are a trade-off
  of time and focus - not a result of me being stupid.</p>
<p>Man, another thing kicking around in my head is this new Kanye album.
  The reviews finally started coming out, and they&#8217;re not looking good.
  My favorite music reviewer even gave it a 4/10.  I love the album, and
  that doesn&#8217;t change; but the critical reception of Jesus Is King has
  already put things in perspective.  I was sobered remembering how much
  I enjoyed watching Chance&#8217;s <i>The Big Day</i> get ripped apart by the
  presses, and how much I egged everyone on.  I did the same thing with
  Eminem&#8217;s latest album.</p>
<p>I still love the album, but the first time you listen to something
  after the reviews come out always feels a little different - like
  you&#8217;re burying your head in the sand because you&#8217;re afraid to confront
  something.</p>
<p>I think the album is good, and people will grow to like it over time.
  If you read the reviews, it seems like people are too hung up on the
  concept to enjoy the music.  Yes - whether or not Kanye&#8217;s faith is
  genuine, he&#8217;s not qualified to lead you in worship.  Attending a
  church and leading it are not the same thing.  The lyrics are a little
  misguided.  Even wrapped in the robes of religion, he still finds
  plenty of places for his ego to shine brighter.  But Kanye&#8217;s depravity
  and ego has always been a part of his music.  One of his albums is
  called &#8220;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.&#8221;  He has a song called &#8220;I
  am a god,&#8221; for crying out loud.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;d encourage you to just listen to the music.  Do your best to
  forget about Kanye, how expensive his silly ripped t shirts are, and
  how many times he&#8217;s delayed the release of this very brief album.
  Just listen to the album.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my time.  As always, thanks for reading.  I had a lot of
  things to get out of my head this morning, and as a result I&#8217;m feeling
  lighter and happier.</p>
