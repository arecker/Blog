<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone - and happy Halloween.  This morning was a
  little more complicated than usual, as I had to figure out how to slip
  into my Spider-Man costume and conceal all the revealing bits so it
  would be work place appropriate.  I spent about five minutes
  deliberating and staring at the bathroom mirror, and I finally settled
  on a black pair of athletic shorts.  I think I made the right call.
  Today the front of the costume wasn&#8217;t looking too bad, but after I
  thought to turn around and check the butt situation, things were
  looking pretty HD back there, if you catch my drift.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I worked from home all day, and took
  a break to meet Rob at Glass Nickel for some lunch.  Afterwards, I
  knocked out some more work, then decided to put on my costume for my
  last meeting of the day, which earned a nice laugh.  Truth be told,
  it&#8217;s really comfortable in this thing.  It feels like something that
  you would wear while running outside, except it covers your fingers.
  But it&#8217;s warm, and I definitely don&#8217;t feel naked (although without the
  black shorts, I assure you I look naked).</p>
<p>After work, we all put our Halloween costumes on.  Rodney was not
  having it - it took lots of time to ease him into the idea, and
  through literal kicking and tears, getting his costume on one leg,
  arm, and finger at a time.  What really complicated the whole thing
  was that Marissa and I were already in costume at this point.  I could
  imagine that if you were peering into our house during that noisy half
  hour, seeing Spider-Man and Spider-Woman rough up a screaming toddler
  would have been quite the site.</p>
<p>After Rodney got his suit on, we all sat on the couch and cooled down
  with an episode of Blippi.  I jumped around the living room to get
  some laughs out of him, and Rodney slowly warmed up to the idea.  We
  bundled up and jumped in the car, making our way downtown.</p>
<p>Looking around the square, Marissa started to get nervous.  &#8220;So just
  updating you all, I don&#8217;t see anyone in costume yet,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s
  OK, everyone is probably just on State Street or something,&#8221; I assured
  her.</p>
<p>We made our way to State street.  There was still no costumes to be
  seen.  We ducked into an ally to avoid the chilly wind while Marissa
  consulted her phone.  &#8220;So it was last week.  Trick or Treating for the
  kids downtown was on the 23rd,&#8221; Marissa summarized.  We were a week
  late.  Rodney, standing there in his spider-man costume holding an
  empty bucket was none the wiser.</p>
<p>After a quick family meeting outside the Orpheum, we decided to just
  get some fudge instead.  &#8220;Dude, the only thing better than a bucket
  filled with candy is a bucket full of fudge,&#8221; I assured Rodney.  We
  turned into the fudge shop and picked out some chocolate covered
  pretzels, some fudge, and a bear claw - that was for me, for later.</p>
<p>As we paid for our treats, we chatted with the owner, who was nice
  enough to offer us some caramel apple samples.  It turns out we knew
  the guy through a friend.  We told them about how we thought the kids
  were trick or treating on the square and were getting fudge in lieu of
  candy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well here, we have some extra candy too,&#8221; he said, grabbing a bag
  from the back.  Rodney held out his paint bucket and repeated my words
  quietly - <i>Tricker-Treat</i>.  Marissa carried on the conversation.  &#8220;I&#8217;m
  just worried that we stick out like a sore thumb - I feel like
  everyone can tell we made a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah, you just look like fun people,&#8221; he said closing the fudge case.</p>
<p>We left the fudge shop and walked back into the square.  We decided to
  eat out at the old fashion.  I put on my mask, and put Rodney on my
  shoulders, and we got plenty of fist bumps and <i>Hey Spidey!</i>&#8217;s along
  the way.</p>
<p>We ate dinner at the Old Fashioned, then made our way to the car.  I
  decided to scare Marissa by putting on my mask and jumping on the hood
  of the car after everyone climbed in.  She decided to scare me in
  return by slowly backing the car out while I was on top.  She called
  my bluff, probably knowing that I couldn&#8217;t really see anything with my
  mask on.  I flopped off the car and got in.</p>
<p>I kept my suit on while I put Rodney to bed.  As I guided Rodney
  through his bedtime routine, I noticed that he addressed me as
  <i>Spider</i>, and was more prompt than usual with following instructions.
  Maybe the suit commands an extra sense of authority.</p>
<p>After I came down stairs, I chatted with Marissa, who was on the couch
  gulping down a sparkling water.  &#8220;Is it just me or was that dinner way
  too salty?&#8221; she complained.  &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m completely parched, and I just
  got the soup.&#8221; I assured her.</p>
<p>I finally took off my suit so I could knock out my chores for the
  evening.  I earned extra husband points by dicing the rest of
  Marissa&#8217;s red onion in the fridge - that&#8217;s part of her <i>salad stash</i>.
  She joked that she expected me to just throw everything out.  &#8220;I
  thought about it,&#8221; I laughed.  &#8220;But then I&#8217;d just have to buy it all
  again.&#8221;</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;m wearing the suit to work, and after test driving it
  yesterday, I&#8217;ve put plenty of thought into how I&#8217;ll get through the
  day.  Since touch screens are a lot harder to use, I&#8217;m even bringing
  my own wireless mouse.  Today should be a mostly regular work day, but
  I&#8217;m pretty sure there is also a Halloween party mixed in there.  I&#8217;m
  not going to lie to you, readers.  I like wearing the suit - not just
  because it&#8217;s comfortable, but I like feeling a little like Spider-Man.
  I feel like I could walk outside and foil a mugging, or stop a runaway
  subway - as long as I&#8217;m not wearing the mask, I can barely walk in a
  straight line with that thing on my face.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween, everyone.  Stay safe out there!</p>
