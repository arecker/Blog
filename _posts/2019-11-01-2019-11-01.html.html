<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone - and Happy November 1st!  It&#8217;s exciting to
  begin a new month, even if this next month will be darker, colder, and
  a little busier.  From the last time we glanced at our calendar,
  Marissa and I realized that this coming weekend is the last empty one
  we have in a while.  For us, November will be lots of driving,
  visiting, hosting, and - of course - cooking.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty wonderful day.  I wore my Spider-Man suit all
  day, and had a lot of fun doing regular things with my mask on.  I
  kept it on my desk all day, and I put it on to get coffee refills,
  attend meetings, and pick up lunch from Quizno&#8217;s.  In the morning, I
  went down to the seventh floor for a bagel and mimosa with my teammate
  Josh, who was dressed like a vampire.  While mingling, I bumped into
  an IT guy, who was also dressed liked Spider-Man.  And despite our
  costumes, you could definitely tell we both worked in the tech sector
  because we immediately - instinctively - re-enacted that one
  Spider-Man meme where <a href="https://i.imgur.com/1WU8ron.jpg">they are pointing at eachother</a>.  After work, I
  took Rodney to the grocery store.  He was pretty upset with me that I
  didn&#8217;t wear the mask while driving, and I was having a hard time
  getting across why that would be a bad idea.</p>
<p>We wanted to have plenty of time for trick or treating, so just picked
  up some pasta, red sauce, and pancietta.  And of course, We got plenty
  of chuckles and high fives wandering around Hy-Vee.  One thing I
  started to pick up on was how awkward people can be about
  acknowledging your Halloween costume.  It felt like people ran up to
  me and spoke before they thought about what to say.  People would just
  point, or run up to me and make a noise, like <i>AHHHHH</i>.  I think what
  learned from yesterday is that the best thing to do when you see an
  exotic costume out in the wild is to just enjoy it from a distance.
  Or at the very least, keep your cool.  As Rodney and I paid for our
  groceries, the cashier very calmly asked &#8220;Did you find everything
  alright, Spider-Man?&#8221;  Finally, some respect for the mask.</p>
<p>When we got home, I cooked pasta while Marissa wrestled Rodney into
  half of his suit.  You&#8217;d think he would have learned to associate
  &#8220;uncomfortable costume&#8221; with &#8220;limitless chocolate and candy&#8221; by now,
  but he was just as reluctant about wearing it as he was the day
  before.  Meanwhile, in full super hero regalia, I was browning
  pancietta and grating parmesan cheese.</p>
<p>We ate dinner, then Rodney and I decided to hit the streets.  A few
  trick or treaters came by before dinner, but things had really started
  to slow down.  Rodney and I bundled up, and Marissa agreed to stay
  behind and man the door.  Rodney and I walked a few houses up our
  street.  There were some neighbors standing outside by a little
  campfire, and they approached us with a bowl of candy.  Rodney was
  silently upset, so I did most of the talking.  They gave Rodney some
  candy, then my neighbor turned to me and asked, &#8220;You want a beer
  Spider-Man?&#8221;  He filled a red cup from a miniature keg and handed it
  to me.  &#8220;I can promise you, it&#8217;s cold,&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>Rodney and I visited a few more houses, but he seems pretty upset.  I
  stopped on the sidewalk and asked him what was wrong.  He whimpered
  something about getting momma.  &#8220;Do you want to go home and get
  momma?&#8221;  His eyes lit up as he took the initiative and started walking
  home.</p>
<p>We knocked on our door.  From the window, I saw Marissa spring up off
  the couch, pausing <i>The Office</i> reruns.  &#8220;I think he&#8217;s mad we left you
  at home,&#8221; I reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh thank goodness,&#8221; Marissa said in a sigh of relief.  &#8220;No trick or
  treaters, and I was starting to get bored.  I was actually cleaning
  out my inbox.&#8221;</p>
<p>We jumped in the car and drove a little further down the street,
  parking by a small cluster of festively decorated houses.  There were
  more neighbors standing outside by a fire.  Rodney, who was in silent
  protest up until now, was suddenly running his mouth and babbling
  about costumes, candy, and trick or treating.  He proudly marched up
  the steps of the next house, leaving us behind.  As the neighbor
  dropped some candy in his bucket, he waved and said HAPPY HALLOWEEN.
  &#8220;Well look who&#8217;s suddenly Mr. Halloween over here,&#8221; I teased.</p>
<p>We hit a few more houses until the cold got the best of us.  We went
  home, emptied our candy onto the table, then snapped a few pictures of
  us in costume.  We took a few of each other, then spent about five
  minutes trying to set up the camera on the stairs with a timer so we
  could get a family shot.  As these things usually work out, the
  picture we spent the most time on getting was the most unusable.  Kind
  of unsettling actually.  We&#8217;re off center, a bit out of focus, and
  Rodney looks perturbed.  Like a bizarre man &amp; wife Spider-Man
  kidnapping ransom photo.</p>
<p>We snacked on candy and watched a little more of Frozen.  After
  Rodney&#8217;s eyes started to droop, I put him to bed and changed out of my
  costume.  After wearing the spandex suit for literally the entire day,
  it felt good to change into regular clothes.</p>
<p>I cleaned the kitchen, then Marissa and I crashed on the couch to
  watch some YouTube.  We watched a cooking video for making forest
  mushroom cream sauce, then Nick Offerman&#8217;s Hot Ones interview.  We
  closed out the night by finishing our movie pick <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i> -
  the Leonardo DiCaprio version.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got.  Today is a regular work day.  Heading into the
  weekend, I&#8217;m very mindful of how precious an empty Saturday is.
  Marissa and I are still racking our brains for how to spend it, but at
  the very worst, we&#8217;re just going to hang around the house, and maybe
  cook some mushroom and cream sauce tonight.</p>
<p>Have a great day, everyone.  Oh, and I just noticed I journaled every
  day in October.  For those of you who read every journal in October,
  thanks for the loyalty.  Here&#8217;s to beginning a colder, darker,
  heartier month!</p>
