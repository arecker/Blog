<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  Wherever you are, I hope you are finally
  getting adjusted to the time change.  Complaints about daylight
  savings aside, at least it falls on a weekend, so you have a day or
  two to sort yourself out.  It&#8217;s 7:28 AM where I&#8217;m writing this, and
  that feels just about right.  Rodney, on the other hand, is wide
  awake, throwing his stuffed animals around.  I take it he isn&#8217;t quite
  adjusted yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much brighter this morning.  Sometimes I forget that that&#8217;s kind
  of the point behind daylight savings.  It&#8217;s supposed to give us more
  light in the morning.  Or is it?  That&#8217;s one of those things I&#8217;d
  really have to sit back and think about, but what&#8217;s the point?</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty full &amp; fun day.  We made it to early church,
  and as we were picking up Rodney at the end of the service, the Sunday
  school teacher said Rodney is getting really comfortable playing with
  other kids.  Usually, before we get him, Marissa and I like to spy for
  a few minutes.  You very rarely get to observe your kid like that, and
  it&#8217;s interesting to see what they do when you&#8217;re not around.  Our last
  church actually had a two way mirror.  It kind of reminded me of a
  psychology lab.</p>
<p>After church, we went home for a bit.  Rodney watched some TV while I
  cleaned up my AWS bill - which was long overdue.  AWS is scary
  business because most of the billing goes off of usage, so most months
  it&#8217;s only a few cents here and there, but I guess conceivably if any
  of the 8 or so silly websites I own suddenly got popular, I could be
  looking at a nasty bill.  I moved a handful of sites over to the much
  thriftier github hosting, and for only having about an hour at home
  before our next outing, that was pretty good.  I cut the bill in half,
  from $6 a month to $3 and change.  <i>High fives self</i>.</p>
<p>We all jumped in the car and drove over to Alex and Cassie&#8217;s house.
  Rod brought his bilingual airplane &amp; airport set.  We ate pizza,
  knocked back a few beers, and watched the Bears go out with a whimper
  against the Eagles.  Watching the game with other people made it a
  little easier to stomach how bad the offense was playing yesterday.
  It was also great catching up with Alex and Cassie.  They have a cool
  place downtown, and you can see the capital right out their living
  room window.</p>
<p>After the game, we went home, and Marissa and Rodney took a long nap
  until dinner.  I was thinking about cooking something, but Marissa
  talked us into just having the leftovers from our fridge - which was a
  good decision.  Getting a break from cooking, I had plenty of energy
  to straighten up the house.</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, Marissa and I worked on the IT corner.  I
  powered everything off while she sanded and drilled three wood
  shelves.  I held the boards and brackets in place while she screwed
  them to the wall.  About an hour and a half later, I had everything
  plugged in, finally hitting the big red button.  I was very pleased
  that all of my home infrastructure passed the &#8216;reboot test&#8217;.  Normally
  when you turn everything off, then on again, at least one thing needs
  to be manually reconfigured, but last night the IT gods smiled upon me
  and everything gracefully warmed back up again.  The shelves look
  pretty sweet, too.  I decided not to go nuts with the cable management
  until I get a few missing parts, but just having all the crap sitting
  on a shelf makes it look much neater.</p>
<p>After finishing the shelf, Marissa and I finished watching <i>Bridge of
  Spies</i>.  It was a long movie, but ultimately worth it.  Tom Hanks has
  the kind of face that earns your trust.  Like, if Tom Hanks were
  telling a really long story, I would hang with it until the end - same
  goes for his movies, I guess.</p>
<p>This morning, I have &#8220;nesting&#8221; on the brain.  Marissa just finished
  her first trimester.  And by &#8220;trimester&#8221;, I mean a third of a human
  pregnancy.  We found out we were having another baby - well - one
  trimester ago, and as I&#8217;m about to tell my work later today, I figured
  I might as well also tell the ol&#8217; blog about it too.  While I have big
  news, I don&#8217;t have a lot of reflections this morning.  Remember, I&#8217;ve
  known for a while.  But trust me, I hate it when there are big things
  going on in my life that I can&#8217;t write about.  I like this journal to
  be as porous with my personal life as possible, and plus there were
  plenty of mornings when I didn&#8217;t have <i>anything</i> to talk about, and I
  could have used the extra material.</p>
<p>But back to what I was saying - this week, &#8220;nesting&#8221; is top of mind.
  As I was walking through the house rebooting things before the shelf,
  it came to my attention that some of the IT in the house has been
  neglected.  I think the last time I threw a weekend at our home
  network was when I mounted everything to the wall.  It&#8217;s due for
  another pass, especially with Christmas coming up.  Last night before
  bed I was adding things to my amazon wishlist.  I think I&#8217;d like to
  move the router pieces into an &#8220;open air case&#8221;, which is basically
  just a metal bracket that holds all the parts as a stable unit without
  a big computer tower.  I just learned there was a name for it last
  night.  Don&#8217;t you just love when you find out there&#8217;s a name for the
  possibly imaginary thing you&#8217;re picturing in your head?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also a little behind on chores.  I keep up with my daily and
  weekly chores pretty well, but the house could use some love before it
  gets cold outside.  Last night, I was kicking around the idea of
  establishing a cleaning power hour in the evenings - something like
  9pm to 10pm - where I just pick one neglected corner of the house and
  knock it out of the park.  Marissa rolled her eyes as I interrupted
  myself, assuring her &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t bug you about this, this is just a
  &#8216;me&#8217; thing.  You have enough to do,&#8221;.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Wherever you are, I hope you have a great
  morning and a great rest of the day.  I hope you take advantage of the
  last remaining days of above freezing temperature.  Go for a walk in
  the rain, or drive somewhere with your windows open - it&#8217;s going to be
  a long winter!</p>
