<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Wednesday.  Man, it&#8217;s absolutely
  beautiful outside.  It started to snow last night before we went
  upstairs to bed, and this morning we woke up to the most perfect layer
  of powder.  The kind that sticks to the grass, but not really to the
  roads.  I&#8217;m sure the &#8220;OK that&#8217;s enough - I&#8217;m sick of this now&#8221; snow is
  following close behind, but for now I can&#8217;t help but admire the
  beauty.  Our city of Madison looks absolutely beautiful in the
  winter.  It looks good in the fall too.</p>
<p>The snow is putting me in a very good mood today.  That, and I did a
  lot of cleaning yesterday.  As part of last night&#8217;s <i>Nesting Power
  Hour</i>, I tackled the cubbies in which we store our shoes and coats.  I
  was a little intimidated at first.  I don&#8217;t remember the last time I
  cleaned out those bins.  I doubt I&#8217;ve ever gone through them - and
  over time some interesting objects slipped into the bottom of the
  cubbies.  Among the rubble, I found a few lose dog treats, diapers,
  screws, mosquito trap refills, and Rodney&#8217;s long lost giraffe themed
  monster truck.  I sent everything through the washer, and I laid out
  the rest of the miscellany out on the dining room table.  To conclude
  Nesting Power Hour, Marissa and I sorted through the pile.  I felt a
  little like an archeologist.</p>
<p>Cleaning is a lot like archeology, isn&#8217;t it?  What better way to study
  the layers of forgetfulness that accumulate in your own home.  I used
  to think cleaning was a binary operation - a room is either <i>clean</i> or
  <i>messy</i>.  But the more I clean, the more complicated it gets.
  Cleaning is about making sure people can get to the things they use.
  Things people use often should be easy to retrieve and put back, and
  things that are only used once in a while can be kept behind or
  underneath everything else.  Cleaning my house feels like
  defragmenting a hard drive - as long as nobody is using the disk, go
  through everything you&#8217;re storing and optimize it.</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve conquered the shoes &amp; coat cubbie, I feel like we can
  do anything.  My shoes are a little damp this morning, but it was
  worth it.  I&#8217;ll take cold shoes if it means I also get the warm
  satisfaction that I got it done.</p>
<p>After cleaning, Marissa and I watched some more of the <i>Karate Kid</i>.
  Here&#8217;s my ice cold take for the day - the <i>Karate Kid</i> is an amazing
  movie.  Marissa and I were spellbound, and having about a half hour
  left in the film, I was tempted to stay of up late and power through.
  But our adult sensibilities got the best of us and we just saved it
  for the next night.</p>
<p>So what else is going on.  Today I&#8217;m heading into the office.  Usually
  I work from home on Wednesdays, but there is a team lunch on our
  calendar, and we have a big change we&#8217;re rolling out into production
  today.  I spent all day getting ready for it yesterday, filling out
  website paper work, cross checking config files, and doing UTC time
  math.  Timezone math - that&#8217;s something that I used to dread, but it&#8217;s
  not so bad with enough practice.  To convert something from CST to
  UTC, you just add six hours (five hours if the fall time change hasn&#8217;t
  happened yet).  Converting to the west coast is minus two hours.  East
  coast is plus one hour.  Repetitive paper work can help you nail down
  that skill, much like how the repetitive movements of painting a fense
  and waxing cars made Daniel-son suddenly good at karate.</p>
<p>I normally walk through my day chronologically, but I guess I&#8217;m
  jumping around today.  For dinner, I made an asparagus &amp; pork Dutch
  baby.  It&#8217;s a quick meal, and while getting it to <i>puff up</i> like our
  more classic breakfast breakfast variety still eludes me, it still
  makes for a decent dinner quiche.  We all split a castiron&#8217;s worth,
  with a side of apple sauce.  I also drizzled mine in hot sauce.  These
  days, I&#8217;m really enjoying <i>The Chicago</i>, which is like a smokier, more
  jalapeno focused version of <i>Los Calientes</i>.  It&#8217;s also just a little
  too runny.  Between all the bottles of hot sauce on my shelf, I&#8217;ve
  found good heat, good consistency, and good flavor, but never all
  three.  Plenty check two of the boxes; and beleive me, some of the
  sauces check <i>none</i> of the boxes.</p>
<p>So I guess that&#8217;s what I got going on today.  Just a team lunch, big
  change in the afternoon, then I&#8217;m finding something else in the house
  to clean.  There are plenty of little corners in the house that could
  use some attention, but I don&#8217;t know if we have any harrowing &#8216;big
  bosses&#8217; remaining.  I think tonight, I&#8217;m just going to cruise around
  the main floor and see how many spots I can hit, and if I run out of
  ideas, I&#8217;m just going to reflash the BIOS of our dining room computer.
  That counts as cleaning, right?  You can clean software too (or in
  this case, firmware).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  By now, I&#8217;ve usually hit a 1000 words, and
  I&#8217;m a little dissapointed that I&#8217;m a little short.  That could be a
  result of this being such a &#8216;head-down-and-work&#8217; kind of week.  It
  could also be a result of me hyphenating long descriptors like
  &#8216;head-down-and-work&#8217;, which will only count as one word.</p>
<p>Wherever you are, hope you have a great day today.  Which corner of
  the house are you afraid to clean?  Think you could get it done in an
  hour?  Don&#8217;t fear the filth, reader.  You are a brave archeologist of
  your own home, and within that junk heap there are things to be
  discovered.  Most of them are probably junk - loose dog treats, unused
  diapers - but who knows, you may have a long lost beloved giraffe
  themed monster truck waiting to be rediscovered.  Have a great day,
  everyone.</p>
