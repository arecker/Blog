<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Sunday.  This morning I&#8217;m coming to you
  from my wife&#8217;s childhood home in Rochester.  The <i>four</i> of us are
  sleeping in her childhood room actually.  Rodney is fast asleep in the
  corner in his small toddler bed, and Marissa beside me.  In a few
  moments, I&#8217;ll wake her up and we&#8217;ll hit the road for Madison.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had my morning coffee yet, so you&#8217;ll have to excuse me if
  this entry is a little sleepier than usual.  The drink of choice for
  waking up in the mornings around here is diet coke.  I&#8217;m tempted to
  grab one out of the basement fridge for my caffeine fix, but I think
  I&#8217;ll hold out for our first stop at Caribou instead.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we left for Rochester in the late morning, after dropping
  the dogs off at a kennel.  Since this was a new place, we got out and
  took a little tour.  We walked through the back where they keep the
  dogs, and I noticed they were playing <i>The Lion King</i> for them on the
  TV.  That&#8217;s considerate isn&#8217;t it?  They also gave Rodney a donut.  He
  selected a powdered donut off the plate and proudly carried it back to
  the car on a napkin.  Before we even got on the highway again, it was
  gone, and Rodney casually handed his wadded up napkin to mom, leaving
  no evidence behind other than the dusting of powdered sugar on his
  face.</p>
<p>I listened to podcasts while the rest of the family dozed off.  We
  picked up lunch at Culver&#8217;s along the way.  We arrived into town in
  the early afternoon, which gave us some time to hang around the house,
  and for Rodney to get some playing time in.  Mimi broke out his
  &#8216;roller coaster&#8217;, which is a long plastic hilly track and a little car
  he can sit on and ride down.  Rodney quickly remembered how to set the
  car, climb the little stairs, and kick off with his feet.  As Rodney
  played, we caught up with the family.  The whole family was home for
  the weekend, and it was wonderful to catch up with everyone.</p>
<p>Marissa and I left to set up her gallery at Forager around five.  They
  led us back into a cozy room with a bar and some tables.  Her
  paintings were hung on the wall.  She laughed and fixed a painting
  that was hung up side down.  I guess people forget that these things
  are meant to be hung a certain way.</p>
<p>Friends, family, and curious art patrons trickled in as Marissa and I
  nibbled on some firewood pizza.  She sold two paintings right off the
  wall.</p>
<p>We stayed through dinner, and Rodney went how with his grandma and
  grandpa a little early so he could get to bed.  Marissa and I hung out
  with Auntie Sarah and Uncle Mike.  By Sarah&#8217;s recommendation, I
  ordered the pomegranate juicy sour beer.  The deep murky candy purple
  colored got my curiosity and I had to try it.  It was tart, complex,
  and a little girly.  I felt like it would have been complete with a
  little umbrella coming out the top.</p>
<p>Marissa and I went home around 10:30.  We wanted to get some good
  sleep, knowing we&#8217;d hit the road around 8.  And speaking of which,
  this will probably be a shorter entry today.  Hey - I did what I
  could, and I think 500-600 words with no coffee is pretty respectable.
  We need to pick up the dogs at a certain time, and as an added benefit
  that means we&#8217;ll also make it home in time for the Bears game.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Wear something comfortable
  and sit on the couch, and maybe watch the Bears play the Lions.</p>
