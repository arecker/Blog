<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  I&#8217;m feeling a little groggy today.  This week
  I&#8217;m on-call, and last night at 2 AM I woke to a handful of pages.
  Sometime last night, Amazon lost power to an availability zone in
  their datacenter in Frankfurt, Germany.  I sleepily watched the
  metrics four about twenty minutes or so, and to my relief, our
  automation took care of things.  The server was automatically
  decommissioned once it stopped receiving network traffic, and a new
  replacement was provisioned in another zone.  I gave a tired fist bump
  to myself before drifting off to sleep.  It wasn&#8217;t so bad after all.
  It was kind of the same sensation you get when you accidentally wake
  up an hour before your alarm, check your phone out of habit, then
  happily fall back asleep.  And plus, yesterday I rediscovered the
  PagerDuty App&#8217;s custom notifications, which are pretty hilarious.  I
  have my phone set to &#8220;Barber Shop Quartet - The Server&#8217;s On Fire&#8221;.  So
  what woke me last night wasn&#8217;t the usual dignified &#8220;chirp&#8221;, but
  instead a barber shop quartet singing the refrain <i>Theeee
  serrrrrrrverrrrrr&#8217;s ooooooon fiiiiiiiiiiire</i>.  Dramatic stuff.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day.  After our team meeting, I attended
  Monday morning Ki Gong with Justin.  He was standing in the glass yoga
  room on the ninth floor staring out into the snow, which was blowing
  upwards and sideways against the face of our building.  &#8220;It&#8217;s like
  we&#8217;re standing inside of a snow globe,&#8221; he remarked in wonder.</p>
<p>Since it was just the two of us for class, he took a more instructive,
  tutoring approach.  He showed me something called the
  &#8220;self-rejuvenating&#8221; routine, in which we massaged our hands, feet, and
  legs.  As we switched from tapping our head, rubbing our hands
  together and passing them over our eyes, digging our fingers into the
  back of our calf, and beating ourselves in the chest, he explained to
  me that this Ki Gong stuff isn&#8217;t nearly as mystical as people think it
  is.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not magic, it&#8217;s just a theory,&#8221; he explained.  &#8220;And even
  though they can&#8217;t explain why this stuff makes you feel good, they
  don&#8217;t need to.&#8221;  We finished the session by <i>charging up our organs</i>
  with <i>good vibrations</i>, which sounds like a strange Beach Boys song,
  doesn&#8217;t it?  We tapped and struck various pressure points in the
  chest, legs, and neck.  When I stood up, I felt light on my feet, and
  almost like my pores had opened.  Ki Gong is good stuff, and now I
  couldn&#8217;t imagine starting a week of ticket duty without it.  Justin
  humbly thanked me for attending, then we parted ways.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the day trying to be as helpful as possible,
  bouncing between slack conversations, scheduling production changes,
  and commenting on tickets.  For lunch, I scooped my hilarious chicken
  caesar salad into a bowl and mashed up a hardboiled egg, because
  apparently it <i>still</i> didn&#8217;t have enough protein for me.  Now that
  I&#8217;ve started paying attention, you can really tell I don&#8217;t eat a lot
  of salads.  I clearly have no idea what I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p>At 4:30, I jumped on a bus and made a grocery list.  Marissa formerly
  requested deep dish pizza, and she didn&#8217;t need to say it twice.  It&#8217;s
  a little hard to fit into a weeknight meal, but Marissa and Rodney
  don&#8217;t mind if dinner is delayed by ten minutes or so.  I woke Rodney
  from his nap, and we went to the store.  He was bundled up in his
  jacket and gloves, and very talkative from the day.  He played outside
  in the snow while Mom shoveled the driveway.  Marissa tried to build a
  snowman with him, but Rodney had more fun knocking it over.  Boys,
  right?  Boys suck.</p>
<p>As I made the pizza, Marissa chatted in the kitchen while Rodney
  wandered around living room playing with his toys.  He made us each a
  playdough cupcake on a tiny plate with a fork, probably to hold us
  over while we hungrily waited for the pizza.  That was considerate of
  him, and probably made up for his earlier display of violent
  aggression against snowman arts.</p>
<p>I did something a little different with the pizza last night.  I
  decided to leave out the store bought marinara and see if I could
  achieve the desired thick &amp; sweet deep dish sauce using only canned
  tomatoes.  Not only did it taste better, but it cooked much faster and
  the consistency was much more appealing.  When you simmer the tomatoes
  in marinara, the tomato eventually completely disappears and you don&#8217;t
  get those nice chunks sprinkled throughout.  But simmering in only a
  bit of water from their can, the beautiful tomato chunks had nowhere
  to hide and were forced to stand proudly atop the pizza.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proud of my deepdish recipe.  It feels like a real milestone in my
  home cooking life.  Deep dish pizza was always a childhood hometown
  favorite of mine, but since I could only enjoy it after waiting an
  hour at Lou Malnati&#8217;s, I had it on a pedestal and just assumed that
  making it at home would never be practical.  To add to it, the amount
  of diverging deep dish advice on the Internet is overwhelming.  And
  one of my favorite parts about my variation is that over time it has
  gotten simpler.  There are fewer ingredients in the dough &amp; sauce, and
  it&#8217;s becoming a lot more reproducible.  Maybe I&#8217;ll make an
  instructional video and throw it on YouTube.</p>
<p>For Monday&#8217;s power hour, I started the week out strong by cleaning
  behind the living room couch.  Couches are amazing.  It&#8217;s a pretty
  fascinating view of how your family relaxes.  Crayons, coffee spills,
  popcorn, socks - I&#8217;ll spare you the gory details, but it&#8217;s been a
  while since I cleaned underneath the cushions.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  I hope you all have a wonderful day
  today.  Remember to charge your organs, spend some time today staring
  at the snow, and cook pizza for your family.  As for me, I have
  another day of work, where I&#8217;ll be cruising the backlog for tickets
  and vigilantly waiting for the barber shop quartet to sing <i>The
  Serrrrrrrverrrrrr&#8217;s Oooooon Fiiiiiiiire.</i></p>
<p>Oh, and to any new readers in the Redalen family slack channel,
  welcome!</p>
<p>Have a great Tuesday, everyone.</p>
