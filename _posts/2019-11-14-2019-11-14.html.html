<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  Today <i>feels</i> like a brand new day, and I
  definitely needed one.  Yesterday sucked.  Yesterday blows.  If
  yesterday were an employee of mine, I&#8217;d have fired him yesterday, and
  yelled &#8220;don&#8217;t let the doorknob hit you on the ass&#8221; on his way out.
  But you would have never known it from my cheery journal entry about
  french cooking, and mildly griping about our stove&#8217;s missing burner.
  I did a pretty nice job getting in a good headspace for writing, but
  things started to roll downhill when it came time to publish it.  My
  script failed, and it took a few minutes and some manual tweaking to
  fix it.  Meanwhile, as I was sitting there at the breakfast table
  completely ignoring Rodney, my phone buzzed, reminding me I had a
  meeting.  It threw me off because our morning stand-up usually isn&#8217;t
  until 9:30, but today it was moved, so I scrambled to set Rodney up by
  the TV and join the remote meeting.</p>
<p>The rest of the work day was kind of a progression of self-inflicted
  disruptions.  I had the usual ticket duty workload of fielding
  questions and jumping on things that broke, but this week I may have
  over-committed myself.  At some point, while I was working upstairs
  Marissa brought me a plate of hot pizza and a beer.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t even
  remember eating it,&#8221; I recounted with her later.  &#8220;It just kind of
  slid down my throat while I was working.&#8221;</p>
<p>At 3:30, I wrapped up my last meeting for the day, and took about
  twenty minutes to just sit there and stare out the window.  Marissa,
  Rodney, and the dogs joined me on the bed before they left to run
  errands.  I chipped away at some more work, then called it a day at
  4:30.</p>
<p>As Marissa napped, I clicked around YouTube looking for a dinner
  recipe.  Marissa advised, &#8220;no preferences tonight, just cook something
  that makes you happy.&#8221;  Chef John had a recipe for kimchi fried rice,
  and that looked pretty simple and quick, so I added the ingredients to
  the grocery list and trotted upstairs to get Rodney.  He was already
  awake and staring out the window.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful time at Hy-Vee.  We looked at the Christmas toys,
  then chatted with the butcher about these giant tiger prawns they were
  selling.  &#8220;I mean, if you&#8217;re going to spend that much money on
  shellfish, why aren&#8217;t you just buying lobster,&#8221; he laughed.  &#8220;So I
  take it your not making commission on these things?&#8221; I added.  The
  butcher bagged up our <i>regular</i> shrimp and sent us on our way.</p>
<p>We got home, and Rodney wanted to help in the kitchen.  So I started
  to make a batch of white rice and peel the shrimp.  As I cooked, I
  started to realize that shopping at Hy-Vee was just a temporary mood
  lifter and that I was still kind of burnt out from work.  I even
  snarled at Rodney a few times.  As I scolded, &#8220;Rodney dude, if you&#8217;re
  going to be in the kitchen, I expect you to help, not just screw
  around.&#8221;  Rodney looked up from confusion, holding his &#8220;hammer&#8221; (which
  is really just a corkscrew opener) and a fist full of butcher&#8217;s
  twine.  I wanted to take the words back as soon as they left my
  mouth.  What does that even mean?  When does a three your old do
  anything <i>but</i> screw around?  I felt sick to my stomach.</p>
<p>And the culinary gods evidently were not pleased with my attitude
  either.  My fried rice immediately adhered to my cast iron pan, and
  the rice left over got stickier, starchier, and the garlic, kimchi,
  and hot pepper paste was just not working.  The meal smelled and
  tasted a lot like I felt inside - thrown together and &#8216;burnt out&#8217;.  I
  guess there&#8217;s no hiding in cooking.  My food always seems to reflect
  how I&#8217;m feeling.</p>
<p>As we picked at the bowl of rice I made, Marissa set down her fork.  I
  suggested she make a salad, and she kindly offered to make Rodney a
  peanut butter and jelly.  &#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s too spicy?  I haven&#8217;t
  heard him complain.&#8221;  I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Rodney doesn&#8217;t complain about spicy foods anymore,&#8221; she replied.
  &#8220;He just drinks his milk faster.&#8221;  Rodney nodded, trying to keep up
  with the conversation.  His milk was already empty.  I got up and
  dumped my rice in the garbage, then grabbed a bag of paw patrol fruit
  snacks.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; I said at the dinner table, &#8220;today sucks, and
  this didn&#8217;t work the way I wanted it to.&#8221;  Marissa smiled
  empathetically.  &#8220;Ticket duty pass!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a really long time since I completely bricked dinner, and
  that hurts.  Marissa offered to put Rodney to bed, and I went upstairs
  to take a nap.  &#8220;You need a nap,&#8221; Marissa said.  &#8220;You didn&#8217;t relax at
  all yesterday.&#8221;  That was true.  I suddenly realized my chore time
  rolled right into trying to build that computer case, and that wasn&#8217;t
  a very pleasant experience.</p>
<p>I fell asleep immediately and woke up 45 minutes later to my alarm.
  Despite feeling some acid reflux from my kimchi rice, I felt
  refreshed, and slowly emerged from our bedroom to begin cleaning the
  kitchen.  I let myself get swept away in Kanye&#8217;s new album while I
  scrubbed my cast iron.  As I chipped and flaked each shard of burnt
  rice from the bottom, I could feel my mood slowly turning.  I finished
  my kitchen chores by wiping out my cast iron pans with mineral oil and
  torching them over the stove.  The clean, burning mineral oil felt
  like it was cleansing the kitchen of all the mistakes I made today.
  The <i>culinary gods</i> are fair, but they can forgive too.</p>
<p>For &#8216;power hour&#8217;, I just sat in the dining room with a La Croix and
  responded to emails, then tidied things up on my computer.  It was
  probably the most generous version of &#8220;nesting power hour&#8221; I&#8217;ve done,
  but taking Marissa&#8217;s advice, I needed to relax.  Once I was finished,
  I curled up with Ziggy on the couch and listened to some music.</p>
<p>This morning I&#8217;m feeling good.  I&#8217;m going to try to do a better job of
  guarding my mood.  It will be another busy day, but I&#8217;m going to take
  a solid, quiet lunch, and go for a cold walk around the square.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a good day.  Take some time for yourself.  Go for a
  walk, cuddle with your dog, and send emails to people.  And take care
  of your cast iron, too.</p>
