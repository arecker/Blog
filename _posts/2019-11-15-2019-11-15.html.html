<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  This morning, my text editor is looking crisp
  and lovely.  It&#8217;s good to be back on a regular ol&#8217; HDMI cable.  For
  those who might not remember, for the last week or so, I broke my
  computer while updating the BIOS and suddenly it was no longer able to
  boot with HDMI, and as a temporary workaround I&#8217;ve been using a HDMI
  to VGA dongle.  If you can&#8217;t picture what that plug looks like in your
  head, it&#8217;s that wide ugly one with the little screws on either side.
  And in addition to looking gross and cluttering up the desk, we&#8217;ve
  been without audio and limping by with a fuzzy resolution.  Last
  night, Marissa groaned while trying to get audio to play out of a two
  foot AUX cord and our tiny speaker.  She wanted to watch Harry Potter
  while painting frames.</p>
<p>For a week of &#8220;everything&#8217;s on fire&#8221;, it felt good to finally get a
  win and start fighting back.  And getting the dining room computer
  working is important, since that&#8217;s where every day begins (it&#8217;s where
  I write these entries).  Well, I use the term &#8216;working&#8217; loosely.  HDMI
  and audio work, but while kicking the tires last night I discovered
  that Steam remote play no longer works.  When I try to connect from
  the TV, I get all the audio and a solid black screen.  That&#8217;s the way
  these things are - computers are like whack-a-mole.  Once you find an
  arrangement that fixes something, another problem arises.  It&#8217;s like
  every computer in your house has to have a minimum entropy, or <i>bad
  mojo</i>, if you will.  And fixing the resolution last night squeezed
  that bad mojo somewhere else - thankfully somewhere less critical.
  All that means for me is come Sunday, I&#8217;ll have to watch the Bears
  game on our TV with a half closed laptop within cable range.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not too worried about computers gaining
  too much intelligence and enslaving us.  We all know that tech
  companies have a long way to go before they make anything that good.
  My Samsung Smart TV still gets amnesia whenever we turn it out.
  Marissa&#8217;s phone still crashes whenever she gets a voicemail.  My phone
  runs out of disk space whenever I get a software update (no doubt
  because all the old updates are taking up the space).  My macbook at
  work has been plugged into the same monitor for almost four years, and
  it forgets everything about it once a week.  Oh, and just to bring it
  home, anything and everything about Microsoft.</p>
<p>If you ask me, a more likely scenario is that the machines have
  already taken over, and we&#8217;re living in the Matrix.  And in order for
  that to work, all of our tech would have to mysteriously break and
  stagnate for as long as possible under the guise of &#8220;innovation&#8221; and
  &#8220;progress&#8221;.  What I fear more than our tech getting too good is that
  our tech hasn&#8217;t actually changed - only the way we spin it and sell it
  to people.</p>
<p>Machine learning is not AI.  Sticking a wireless card in a toaster or
  a fridge does not make it smarter, it&#8217;s just yet another thing that
  breaks when your Internet goes down.  And streaming services are
  really just cable with extra steps.</p>
<p>If you couldn&#8217;t tell, Marissa and I are in the throws of a Matrix
  trilogy marathon.  Last night we just finished the second
  installment.  Those movies are better than I remember.  When I was
  younger, I watched it mostly for the fight scenes - I think I even
  used to just fast forward through the dialog.  But it holds up.  The
  writing can be a little wordy at times, but it&#8217;s a fascinating movie
  if you pay attention.</p>
<p>And ironically, watching the movie in 2019, it&#8217;s some of the fighting
  scenes that are laughable.  Whenever neo does something unnatural,
  like float in the air, you can see the texture of his skin and hair
  smoothen out while they swap in the CGI version of him right in front
  of you.  &#8220;It&#8217;s like watching an old screensaver kick on in the middle
  of the movie,&#8221; we heckled.</p>
<p>And yes, in this entry I&#8217;m aware of the irony that I make the argument
  that tech might not be getting any better, then go on to mock how bad
  CGI in movies used to look.  CGI has gotten a lot better.  Perhaps CGI
  will get so good that it will enslave humanity.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty wonderful day.  I hit the ticket duty backlog
  hard, but I took a midday break to grab lunch with Rob.  We ordered a
  pair of Zombie Dust beers, and I got a little basket of hot wings.
  Hot wings and beer are such a classic combination, and I&#8217;d challenge
  you to scour the culinary universe for a better pairing.</p>
<p>After work, I hung around the house with Marissa until kids code
  started.  On Thursday, we joke that I get the &#8220;Kids Code scaries&#8221;.
  Since I have to leave the house around 5:30, that leaves me with a
  little less than a half hour, and since I don&#8217;t know what to do with
  myself I just pace around the house in anticipation.  It has less to
  do with the event itself, and more to do with the fact that I just
  have to go somewhere and be social.</p>
<p>Kids Code was wonderful.  The closest thing I had that resembled a
  lesson plan was &#8220;make a game that involves a Turkey&#8221;.  Some kids
  actually took me up on the challenge.  One kid made a turkey edition
  of &#8220;duck hunt&#8221;, but most kids just wisely scribbled a small turkey in
  the corner of their game so they&#8217;d qualify.</p>
<p>The linux laptops were pretty popular yesterday.  One regular club
  member wanted to install something on the Windows laptops we have, and
  was disappointed that we didn&#8217;t have the admin password for the
  library computers (trust me, I don&#8217;t want the admin password either -
  with great power comes great responsibility, right?).  &#8220;We can&#8217;t
  install it on there, but want one of the linux laptops?  We have the
  root password, and you can pretty much do whatever you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marshall hadn&#8217;t heard of linux, but he was intrigued.  As he clicked
  around, he asked me a few more questions.  &#8220;How much does it cost?
  How do you get it on a laptop?&#8221;  As I explained to him that it&#8217;s
  well-document, universally accepted as the standard in most
  engineering disciplines, and completely free-as-in-beer, his eyes
  widened with wonder.  He made the same kind of face that neo did when
  Morpheus said <i>welcome to the REAL world</i>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my time, everyone.  Thanks for reading.  Hope you have a
  wonderful Friday.</p>
