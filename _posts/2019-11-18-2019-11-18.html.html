<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Monday to all of you.  This morning I&#8217;m
  starting my journal entry about two minutes late.  I guess my shower
  took a little longer than expected.  I was already starting to put my
  thoughts together about the Thanksgiving turkey, and I guess I lost
  track of time.  I believe this is the last week before Thanksgiving
  week, so if I&#8217;m going to get at least one practice Turkey in before
  the big day, it will have to happen sometime this week.</p>
<p>And by <i>practice turkey</i>, I mean it.  Before Thanksgiving I make a
  whole turkey, just to practice.  Since last year was my first
  thanksgiving where I was supposed to cook the turkey, I actually made
  three of them out of anticipation.  Last year&#8217;s turned out pretty
  good, so I have a feeling it&#8217;s not going to take three trials.  Maybe
  just one bird to make sure my grill still works the way I expect it
  to.</p>
<p>Ah, last night was a fun night.  In the morning, Rodney and I hung
  around the house.  After finishing breakfast, Rodney retired to the
  living room to binge watch some Blippi, and I tidied up after the
  weekend.  I got on a pretty nice cleaning streak where I caught up on
  laundry, and finally moved all the mugs off the coffee bar and wiped
  it down.  The sprinkles of coffee grounds that have been collecting in
  and around the mugs was starting to bother me.</p>
<p>After a bit, we heated up some lunch, then bundled up to brave the
  drizzly weather to walk to the grocery store.  Rodney reclined,
  snuggling his baby giraffe as I tucked him in using my rain pancho.
  &#8220;Piggies?  Piggies?&#8221; he asked.  In our family&#8217;s custom, &#8220;piggies&#8221; are
  when you get tucked into your blanket so thoroughly that even each of
  your toes get a fair share.  Just goes to show how comfortable he
  really was.</p>
<p>We returned from the store, then I put Rodney down for a nap, changing
  into some dry nap clothes myself.  Just as I was about to settle in
  and bide a few hours half sleeping and half watching YouTube, Marissa
  returned from her dog agility seminar.  The timing was pretty comical.
  I did my best to hang around the kitchen and make her feel welcomed,
  but I must have looked really eager to crash on the couch after a long
  morning of cleaning and hauling a wagon to and from the grocery store.</p>
<p>Around five, I emerged from couch cushions and blankets to begin
  prepping dinner.  As it was game day, I was doing something in the
  junk food realm.  A bloomin&#8217; onion, some homemade fries (since I was
  breaking out the oil anyway), and Chicago style polish sausages.</p>
<p>The fried onion was laborious.  I was having fun cutting the petals
  and shaping the flower up until it came time to prepare the dredge,
  which inexplicably had about six different ingredients involving
  buttermilk, rice flour, and corn starch.  In the end, it all came
  together in a shaggy, tart smelling mess.</p>
<p>As I was dredging the flowered beast in flour, struggling to find
  bowls and plates in my kitchen large enough to contain the work area,
  it dawned on me that I probably should have picked a smaller onion.
  In a moment of pure mental disconnect I went for the largest organic
  vidalia onion in the box.  The cashier even complemented me - <i>that is
  the biggest onion I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life</i>.  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to deep fry
  it!&#8221; I said loudly enough for the whole store to hear.  They must have
  though I was some kind of weirdo, had some kind of death wish, or had
  some kind of underground lab with a hot oil vat big enough to actually
  do it.  Nope - just a regular dude using a big pot filled precariously
  with hot canola oil.</p>
<p>I used the french fries as a way to measure the readiness of the oil.
  As soon as they were golden brown, I moved them to a pan with paper
  towels and gave the oil a minute to heat up.  I donned by heat proof
  gloves and scooted the fire extinguisher close by, then once I had
  finally mustered the courage, flopped the shaggy dusted onion into the
  oil.  A pillar of steam flung upwards from the pot and a shirked
  behind my fire extinguisher.  I held it close by for the five minutes
  it cooked.  As the steam died down, I approached the pot and gingerly
  rolled the flower to the other side.  Well, it looked delicious.</p>
<p>I plated the flower next to some garlic sauce and woke Marissa up from
  her nap.  She brought Rodney along for the first taste.  We nibbled a
  few petals, and I have to say I was a little disapointed.  Not because
  it turned out bad, but because it tasted exactly like the appetizer
  you&#8217;d order from Outback steakhouse.  And just like eating it at
  Outback, you eat a few petals, then it cools off, then you immediately
  get sick of it.</p>
<p>At least the polish sausages were a redemptive success.  And as these
  things usually work out, they took substantially less work than the
  deep fried Outback experience.  I navigated the rubble of rice flour,
  oil droplets, and splotches of flour to slice another onion and sautee
  it with some sausage.  I warmed the buns over some boiling water,
  spread them with mustard, then packed a sausage, some onions, and
  sport peppers on the bun before wrapping it in tinfoil.  The recipe
  was patterned after Jim&#8217;s polish sausage cart, which despite living in
  the backyard of Chicago my whole life, is an ancient Chicago tradition
  I managed to miss.  &#8220;You&#8217;re supposed to eat this on the hood of your
  car,&#8221; I reported.  &#8220;I know this, not because I&#8217;ve done it, but because
  I watched the touristy YouTube video.&#8221;</p>
<p>After dinner, we tidied up the mess, then quickly relocated to the
  couch to watch the Bears game.  The game was truly one of the saddest
  things I&#8217;ve ever seen.  Our kicker hero Eddy missed two field goals,
  and I&#8217;m wondering if he is ever going to hit a field goal again.  The
  defense wasn&#8217;t clicking.  Our run game was deflated.  And on top of it
  all, despite Mitch playing a pretty good game, Matt Nagy benched him
  in the last four minutes when they were only down by a touchdown and
  change.  It was perplexing, and continued to bother me and Marissa
  until we went to bed.  Talking to the reporters, Matt Nagy insisted
  that it was because Mitch had injured his hip, but I find that hard to
  believe based on how he was talking to Mitch on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Our team may be broken right now, but I felt for Mitch.  After the
  game, Marissa and I watched a highlight reel from last season, and I
  was surprised to see he played exactly the same way he did last season
  as he did this season, only it was successful.  He was still
  scrambling, running the ball, and throwing with only one leg on the
  ground, and it was working.  I&#8217;d have to conclude that it was because
  he had better coverage, better receivers, and better overall team
  chemistry.  Mitch isn&#8217;t the ultimate solution, but he&#8217;s not the
  problem either.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  In about 3 minutes, I go off of ticket
  duty, so tonight I&#8217;m going to shut off my phone, cook something, clean
  my house, and stew about the Bears.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.</p>
