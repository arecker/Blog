excerpt: male morning sickness, homemade popsicles, and bbq youtube videos

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re all finding a way to wake up this
  morning, with no help from the dark clouds and gloomy weather.  I&#8217;m
  feeling pretty good this morning, and the coffee is hitting me just
  right.  Yesterday morning, I had a bit of nausea, and just as I
  starting to fall down a Wikipedia rabbit hole researching how common
  sympathetic male morning sickness is, my wife pointed out that she
  things the aggressive blend of coffee we&#8217;ve been drinking is probably
  the cause.  &#8220;Are you sure we&#8217;re not <i>both</i> just having morning
  sickness?  Studies show that it typically begins in men just after the
  first trimester,&#8221; I added.  &#8220;And come to think of it, my hormones <i>do</i>
  feel different.&#8221;  Marissa rolled her eyes.  &#8220;We&#8217;re already a couple of
  weeks into the second trimester, that wouldn&#8217;t be true anyway.&#8221;
  Alright - so psychosomatic morning sickness ruled out.  And come to
  think of it, I did start to feel better once I stopped drinking
  coffee.  Marissa had every right to tease me about thinking I had
  morning sickness, but she was gracious about it and let it go.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I worked from home, hanging out with Rodney.  He
  quietly watched TV as I worked at the table until Mom got home from
  class.  We went out for lunch at Ian&#8217;s pizza, where I got to finally
  try their famous Thanksgiving slice - turkey, stuffing, cranberries,
  green beans, and there even may have been a little gravy on there.  It
  wasn&#8217;t life changing, but I guess making something as ambitious as a
  Thanksgiving-themed pizza, they automatically get an &#8216;A&#8217; if I can eat
  the whole slice without dry heaving.  Good stuff, Ian&#8217;s.  Good stuff.</p>
<p>After we got back, I worked through the afternoon on the couch while
  Marissa put Rodney to bed, then took a nap herself.  I played some
  sketch comedy in the background at a low volume.  After work, we all
  decided to take a trip to Hy-Vee.  Marissa was deep in her nap, and
  resisted waking up for any reason, but after we got in the car and
  started inching through rush hour traffic to the grocery store, she
  said she was grateful I persisted.  &#8220;Waking you up is no small task,&#8221;
  I monologued.  &#8220;I&#8217;m like a vetted foreign ambassador in a hostile
  country.  Every decision in waking you up must be carefully considered
  and planned, or it would have catastrophic effects on the geopolitical
  husband-wife relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hy-Vee was busy.  They were having a problem with their POS system,
  but we weren&#8217;t in a hurry.  I was only planning on making pasta
  tonight, so as long as we got home with enough time to boil a pot of
  water, I was good.  As we stood in line waiting for an available
  cashier to punch in our card number by hand, we chit chatted about the
  day.  As we shopped, Rodney had brought a popsicle mold over to the
  cart and launched into an eloquent defense for why we should purchase
  it and make homemade popsicles.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sold, dude.  But we better pick
  up some juice with it or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we got home, I made pasta in meat sauce.  Despite taking a while
  at Hy-Vee, I still had a little time in the kitchen to jazz things up.
  I snuck in some sliced garlic and a few anchovies into the red sauce
  and had some time to simmered it with a bay leaf.  I use bay leaves
  when I can and when I&#8217;m supposed to, but I still haven&#8217;t exactly
  dialed into what they taste like.  I&#8217;m not sure what they add to the
  cooking, but I appreciate that seeing a bay leave floating around in
  simmering liquid just puts me in the cooking mood.</p>
<p>After dinner, Rodney joined me in the kitchen to take a crack at
  making homemade popsicles.  We put some apple juice on the stove and
  brought the heat up.  I added a few scoops of sugar and a splash of
  vanilla syrup.  Rodney quickly lost interest as soon as he realized I
  was just going to stand there and watch it simmer.  As Marissa took
  him upstairs for a bath, I filled the popsicle mold with a turkey
  baster and stuck it in the back of our freezer.</p>
<p>After Rodney went to bed, Marissa sat in the kitchen trimming frames
  while I bumped some music and did kitchen chores.  Afterwards, I made
  my way to the couch to watch some YouTube and do some more turkey
  research.  I&#8217;m had already reviewed brining, stock, and gravy
  preparation, so now it was time to wade into the world of homemade BBQ
  instructional videos - which is not a world I like to be in.  For most
  things you can make in the kitchen, there is probably a no frills,
  sensibly made and shot YouTube video explaining how to do it, but for
  whatever reason the second you start looking into BBQ the content
  quality takes a dive.  There&#8217;s terrible music, cheesy camera wipes,
  rambling pseudo science, and just a touch of bragging to every
  explanation that teeters on <i>mansplaining</i>.  Also, for some reason all
  of these &#8220;how to BBQ a X&#8221; videos turn into a giant plug for their
  favorite rub.  I think I&#8217;m just going to wing it this year.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  My family is already up, I think Ziggy
  woke everyone up when I came out of the shower and she mistook me for
  a murderer.  I generally appreciate her vigilance.  So as Rodney is
  chatting my ear off as I&#8217;m trying to wrap up this entry, I wish you
  all a happy Thursday.  Remember, male sympathetic morning sickness is
  not as common as you&#8217;d think.  Buy a different blend of coffee before
  you jump to any conclusions.  Hope you all have a great day today.</p>
