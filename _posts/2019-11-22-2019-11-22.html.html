<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  I&#8217;d like to congratulate you on making it to
  Friday.  We&#8217;ve got a nice chilly weekend coming up, and as for me, I
  have the week off yesterday, so I&#8217;m feeling especially relaxed.  I&#8217;m
  looking forward to it.  The last time I took an extended amount of
  time off work was probably when my wife and I went to Vancouver.  So
  some R&amp;R is long overdue.</p>
<p>Next week is really more of a <i>staycation</i>.  We&#8217;re going to eventually
  head up to Minnesota to spend Thanksgiving with Marissa&#8217;s family, but
  in the days leading up to it, we plan on just hanging around the
  house.  I have a practice turkey to cook, and it would be nice to
  catch up on some half-finished IT projects that have been festering in
  our home network.  But worst case scenario, I don&#8217;t end up with as
  much time as I thought I would, and the half built computer case and
  sprawling mess of cables will just have to wait until Christmas.</p>
<p>This weekend, Grandpa Wilke is also visiting.  He&#8217;ll get in late
  Saturday night.  He doesn&#8217;t know it yet, but that&#8217;s around the time I
  hope to have our practice turkey finished, so needless to say if he&#8217;s
  still hungry after rolling off of the plan at night, he&#8217;ll have an
  entire smoked turkey to pick at.</p>
<p><i>Sip</i>.  I&#8217;ve got my Thanksgiving week staycation on the brain, but
  yesterday was a pretty good day in its own rite.  My team wanted to
  set aside some whiteboarding time to think through something we&#8217;re
  building, and my boss suggested we do it over lunch.  We went to
  Cooper&#8217;s, but it was too busy to find a table, so we had to sit at the
  bar.  As we huddled into the crowded bar stools, beers in hand, we let
  loose with the teasing.  &#8220;Oh yeah,&#8221; I remarked scanning the room.
  &#8220;We&#8217;re definitely going to get a lot done in here.  This is the
  perfect place to design software.&#8221; I teased.  And so our software
  planning turned into just a regular lunch, which was fine too.  We
  still had the afternoon to throw some time at it.</p>
<p>After work, I took the bus home, and soon Marissa, Rodney, and I were
  back in the car to run some errands.  We needed to swing by Home Depot
  to pick up some turkey smoking supplies - charcoal, applewood, and two
  5 gallon bucks for the overnight brining.  But we started the evening
  off at Portillo&#8217;s.  As we ordered, the cashier handed Rodney a sheet
  of stickers, and he quickly got busy attaching them to each of us.  I
  got a sticker that said <i>Shake it Up!</i> on my inner thigh.  How
  scandalous, right?</p>
<p>After wolfing down some Portillo&#8217;s, we jumped back in the car and made
  our way to Home Depot.  We spent some time milling around and enjoying
  the Christmas decorations.  It was a much more welcoming scene than
  Home Depot&#8217;s Halloween decorations.  Rodney was especially grateful to
  see them packed away for the season.  But they still managed to get at
  least one creepy decoration in.  Standing in front of the row of
  Christmas trees was a six foot tall realistic Santa statue.  I stood
  close to the figure and made eye contact, taking a moment to
  appreciate the creepiness of his features, especially his lifeless
  eyes.  &#8220;It gets worse,&#8221; Marissa muttered as she sauntered over and hit
  a button on his coat.  Music played, and the Santa&#8217;s arms began to
  stir.  Suddenly he began to sing, slowly blinking and mouthing the
  words with dead lips and dry cloth tongue resting lifelessly in his
  toothless rubber mouth.  It was probably the worst thing I&#8217;ve seen all
  year.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the early evening driving around Sun Prairie,
  dropping off fliers for Marissa&#8217;s upcoming art gallery in different
  coffee shops.  We only head out to Sun Prairie when we go to the movie
  theater, so it was fun getting to know the town a little better.  &#8220;Sun
  Prairie kind of feels like a miniature Greenbay bolted onto the back
  of Madison,&#8221; I remarked.</p>
<p>We finally made our way home, and we went upstairs to put Rodney to
  bed.  He still had some energy, so as he polished off the rest of his
  sippie cup of milk, I let him play with some of my IT toys.  I dumped
  out a bag of HDMI cables and random networking equipment.  He picked
  up an orange tool that looked kind of like an mini cattle prod.  &#8220;DADA
  WASS THIS?&#8221; asked Rodney.  &#8220;You know what, I&#8217;m not sure dude,&#8221; I
  admitted.  &#8220;But just in case it&#8217;s dangerous&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, you can
  look at it, but just be ready for anything.&#8221;  Marissa laughed to
  herself in the corner.</p>
<p>Rodney and I said &#8216;goodnight&#8217; to the cables, then retreated into his
  room for bed.  Marissa spent the rest of the night working, and I made
  my way to the couch to tool around with some home project software.  I
  was trying to deploy jenkins on my new kubernetes cluster, but -
  shocker - it was not straight forward and I had to throw in the towel
  around 11.  Marissa joined me on the couch as I was packing my
  computer away, and we ended the night by watching Chance the Rapper&#8217;s
  hot ones episode.  I had read online that he didn&#8217;t finish all ten
  wings of death, so I was expecting DJ Khaled levels of hubris (that
  may only make sense if you watch the show).  But I actually felt bad
  for the guy.  He made it clear from the beginning that he hated spicy
  food, and all things considered he handled the heat admirably.  And
  even though I wasn&#8217;t a fan of the music Chance put out this year, I
  always appreciate hearing what he was to say.  Chance is also really
  great at describing how other rapper&#8217;s work, which Sean Evens deftly
  questioned.  I liked Chance recapping what a Lil&#8217; Wayne collaboration
  is like, where he &#8220;just stands behind you, not swaying or anything,
  just standing still in the corner, then suddenly he leaves, tells the
  sound guy to cut the music, then records his part with no music in the
  other room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of music, it&#8217;s almost time for the - <i>drum roll</i> - Alex
  Recker best of 2019 hip hop mixtape.  December is right around the
  corner, and since I&#8217;m still committed to burning and labeling the CD&#8217;s
  by hand, I had better get a jump on them soon.  I have some good ideas
  this year, stay tuned.</p>
<p>Oh, and if we have any readers from Instagram, welcome!  I&#8217;ve started
  posting journal entry titles on Instagram - that was a tip from my
  wife, and it was exciting to get a miniature surge of fresh Internet
  traffic.  Of course, I also love the regular traffic too.  I&#8217;m
  humbled, and likewise honored by the regular readership.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  It&#8217;s Friday, go get &#8216;em.  Do
  it for the weekend.  Do it for Thanksgiving!</p>
