<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone! Happy Friday to everyone out there.  My dad and
  I just checked out of our hotel, and now we&#8217;re barreling down the
  Stevenson expressway.  I&#8217;m blogging on the go, courtesy of this
  journal entry&#8217;s sponsor CradelePoint.  I&#8217;m obligated by my sponsor to
  let you know that my Internet speed is 60 Mb/s down, 20 Mb/s up, which
  is unironically competitive with my Internet at home.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a wonderful whirlwind of a day.  Maybe those aren&#8217;t
  choice words for a manly outing of football, beer, and barbecue pork,
  but it was a wonderful time.  Marissa and I got into Geneva around
  noon.  We were a little sad about dropping the dogs off, but we were
  happy to spend some time setting up their bed and toys at the kennel
  they&#8217;d be staying at while we were away.</p>
<p>We got into Geneva around noon, and my mom greeted us at the door,
  signaling we had an opportunity to have some fun and sneak up on
  Rodney, who was well occupied with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
  and a new Blippi episode.  We saw us from the corner of his eye, and
  immediately smiled.  We spent some time hanging around the house,
  cuddling with Rodney, and resting from the long car ride.  &#8220;I&#8217;m
  finally off duty!&#8221; my mom laughed.</p>
<p>About an hour later, I said goodnight to Rodney and Marissa, then
  jumped in the car with my dad.  We checked into a hotel, then made our
  way over to the planetarium parking lot where we&#8217;d be helping out at a
  tailgating event.  We helped set up some tables in between drinking
  beer, then Pat the residential competitive BBQ expert borrowed me for
  some smoked meat related activities.  Donning cloth and latex gloves
  and wielding a meat knife, I helped Pat &#8220;bust up&#8221; five of the most
  savory smoked pork bellies I&#8217;ve ever witnessed, then as he set out the
  sides, I sliced some smoked sausages.  &#8220;Cut them at a 45 degree
  angle,&#8221; Pat instructed.  &#8220;For some reason they look prettier that
  way.&#8221;</p>
<p>After cutting the meat, I grabbed a plate and joined Philip, Jeremy,
  and Kip by the fire.  They were chatting with a stranger who had
  wandered over to heat up.  You&#8217;d think they would be talking about
  football, but instead they were discussing the fire pit.  &#8220;These are
  online,&#8221; Kip explained.  &#8220;It&#8217;s basically just a fire pit, but for some
  reason it costs like $200&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah, it&#8217;s special, it absorbs the smoke or something,&#8221; our new friend
  chimed in.  I shrugged my shoulders and turned to Phillip.  &#8220;I burn
  stuff in my grill all the time, I don&#8217;t feel like I have a big issue
  with smoke,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>With about a half hour before kick-off, we started to wander over to
  Soldier Field.  As night fell, it started to get colder, and I was
  already regretting my decision to leave my winter coat behind.  &#8220;I
  googled it,&#8221; I said defending myself earlier.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not even going to
  get below freezing tonight - you all are going to be too warm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday was my first time in Soldier field.  It was much bigger than
  I expected.  It took us a while to find our seats, and we seemingly
  wandered all over the stadium.  But at last, we settled in, and I was
  able to take in the football game from some pretty prime seats right
  behind the goal line.</p>
<p>Watching an NFL game in person was a notably different experience.
  You can pay attention to any number of things going on that the TV
  cameras miss - the blocking on the offensive line, the body language
  on the bench.  And in moments that would normally be filled with
  commentary and opinions - like a bad call - all you have is the
  roaring and hissing of the angry crowd.  In the first half, the Bears
  were flagged with a &#8220;block from behind&#8221; call, and as the replay played
  on the jumbotron, the crowd erupted with anger seeing the safety
  barely lay a hand on him.</p>
<p>Jeremy and I waited in line during the third quarter to go to the
  bathroom.  On the way there, I bought a new Bears hat.  As I was
  standing in line, two guys in Cowboys jerseys got into a confrontation
  right next to me.  &#8220;The Cowboys suck, the Bears suck, they both suck!&#8221;
  he yelled inches from the other guy&#8217;s face.  &#8220;This league belongs to
  the Patriots - the Patriots are going to win every year!&#8221;  As he
  yelled, surrounding fans shouldered and elbowed him out of the
  bathroom.  &#8220;Shut up idiot! was faintly heard from one of the stalls.
  As the angry fan yelled, the other Cowboys fan raised his hand and
  announced, &#8220;on behalf of the Dallas Cowboys, I apologize for that
  idiot.&#8221;  All of us waiting to use a urinal chuckled.</p>
<p>While I was in the bathroom, Trubisky ran in the ball for a touchdown.
  The replay played on the jumbotron.  I was content that for the first
  time this season the Bears were beating a decent team by three touch
  downs.  And they held it together for the rest of the game - in the
  last few minutes of the fourth quarter, the stadium started to slowly
  empty.  We stayed through the rest of the game, then made our way
  outside the stadium and walked back to the hotel.  Still a bit hungry,
  Jeremy and I continued on to pick up some white castle.  We brought
  back twenty cheese sliders, but only made it through about four of
  them while watching Robocop in the hotel room before we had to turn
  in.</p>
<p>I had a great time at the game.  I&#8217;m grateful I had the chance to have
  some great barbecue, see the Bears beat down the Cowboys at beautiful
  Soldier Field, and bond with friends and family as a new football fan.
  And to add to that, I have a new Bears hat and a set of Bears towels
  that I can&#8217;t wait to hang up in my kitchen by the sink.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re going to recoup at my parents place, then later head back
  into the city to stay with Adam and Sam.  Tomorrow is Marissa&#8217;s art
  show, so more adventures in the city.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Friday.  Bear down, and see you next
  Sunday when we play the Packers!</p>
