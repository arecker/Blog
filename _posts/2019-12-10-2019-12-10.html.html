<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re all staying warm out there.
  According to weather.com, it&#8217;s going to be pretty cold today, so if
  that&#8217;s true for you, make sure you bundle up.  This morning, I&#8217;ve got
  a nice hot cup of coffee on the table, and the rest of my family is
  comfortably sleeping upstairs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad that Rodney finally got some sleep.  Yesterday when I got
  home from work, he woke up from his nap looking pretty terrible.
  Marissa said that all he had for lunch was some water and a couple of
  paw patrol fruit snacks.  His fever spiked a few more times in the
  evening.  Poor guy.</p>
<p>Lucky for him, he doesn&#8217;t have any plans anyway.  Being sick sucks,
  but remember that dreadful feeling of having to catch up on homework
  when you took a sick day in school?  That was always the worst.
  Somehow you&#8217;d end up doing twice the amount of work you normally do,
  and to ensure you&#8217;re not absolutely buried in homework the next day,
  of course you have to get a jump on it when you&#8217;re still feeling sick,
  but well enough to work on something.  I&#8217;m happy that Rodney had
  nothing to worry about.  Last night, after politely excusing himself
  from dinner, we let him settle in on the couch under a blanket and
  zone out to some Blippi.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I got lots of work done.  Contrary
  to what I was thinking yesterday morning in my sleepy Monday delirium,
  I am not on ticket duty, so I have a whole extra week before I need to
  turn on that part of my brain.  And after ticket duty, I have a whole
  week off for Christmas.  That worked out pretty well.  Working extra
  hard, then not working at all is an great pairing, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>I spent most of the day coding, taking breaks to catch up on emails
  and clean up some stuff on my laptop.  I&#8217;m still on the fence about
  asking IT for a new laptop.  Every time it starts acting a little
  wonky, a simple reboot seems to set things straight again, and waiting
  for my computer to reboot is a great time to get a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure there is something ingrained in my head that keeps me
  from returns, refunds, and exchanges.  I&#8217;ll almost always instead find
  work-arounds, or convince myself that I didn&#8217;t really need the thing
  to begin with.  One of the silliest examples of this trait is when I
  bought a skateboarding helmet from target about three years ago.  I
  just needed a helmet so I could ride to work in the mornings, so while
  at Target, I snagged a pretty simple black adult helmet.  Shortly
  after buying it and walking back to the car, I realized that the
  buckle was missing.  A normal person would have turned around and
  gotten a refund, right?  Not me.  Instead, I tied a shoe lace between
  the straps where the buckle should have been.  &#8220;This is fine,&#8221; I
  thought.  &#8220;I can just untie the shoelace when I want to take the
  buckle off.&#8221;  I must have used that helmet for half a year.  In an
  effort to save me from embarrassment, my wife even retied the
  shoelace, and trimmed the excess so it wouldn&#8217;t hang down off my chin
  like a strange feathery goatee.  So there&#8217;s the helmet story - a great
  example of my weird tendency to refuse giving up on something I own,
  no matter how silly the workaround.  And it&#8217;s probably the reason I&#8217;ve
  convinced myself my four year old work laptop is just fine.</p>
<p>After work, leaving Rod to get some much needed sleep, I snuck away to
  Hy-Vee by myself to pick up spaghetti, some pork, and materials to
  make pasta sauce.  But while standing in the aisle from which I
  normally buy marinara, I had a strange impulse to make it from
  scratch.  Maybe I was feeling brave, or more likely I no longer wanted
  to choose between cheap premade marinara and the expensive <i>yuppie</i>
  marinara from the authentic food aisle at Hy-Vee.  So instead, I
  grabbed a can of peeled tomatoes and an extra head of garlic.</p>
<p>I made the marinara a lot like my pizza sauce.  Just some grated
  garlic, olive oil, and a bunch of oregano.  In hindsight, I forgot to
  add the tomato paste - that probably would have made it even better.
  From there, I blended the can of tomatoes and added them to the
  mixture, and let it all gently simmer for about twenty minutes.  After
  a pad of butter, you&#8217;d think it was a can of premade marinara after
  all.  And the cheapness cortex of my brain lit up with endorfins at
  the prospect of saving four dollars.</p>
<p>Continuing the theme of dinner experimentation, I also gave my broiler
  another whirl, this time with some pork, lemon &amp; cheese meatballs.  It
  worked beautifully, searing the meat and giving them a nice crispy
  edge, but it would have been even better if I used tinfoil instead of
  my silicon mat.  It also would have saved me a lot of time, as I had
  to scrub the meatball grease out of it after dinner.</p>
<p>Marissa and I ate pasta while Rod relaxed on the couch.  We tried to
  get him to eat some plain noodles with cheese, but he wasn&#8217;t feeling
  it.  We took him upstairs to give him a bath, which made him feel a
  lot better.  Shortly after, we put Rodney to bed.</p>
<p>For the rest of the night, my plan was to catch up on chores, then
  edit a video for Marissa.  She was even kind enough to take out the
  garbage and wipe down the table so I&#8217;d have more time in the video
  lab.  This was the first footage taken with her new camera, and we
  were both eager to see the results.  However, I didn&#8217;t anticipate how
  the larger raw videos would slow down the editing process.  Usually, I
  speed up the videos, then use the mouse-over scrubbing to trim off the
  dead footage before adding music, but the videos were so large, rich,
  and detailed, that my software choked trying to preview the changes
  and decode everything on the fly.  I think what I&#8217;ll have to do
  instead is run the raw footage through a script that will
  programatically speed them up to make them more tenable in the editor.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  It&#8217;s Tuesday, I&#8217;ve got leftover pasta and
  three meatballs packed in my backpack, and I&#8217;m ready to brave the cold
  and trot over to the bus stop.  Wherever you are, and whatever you&#8217;re
  up to today, I hope you have a wonderful day today.</p>
