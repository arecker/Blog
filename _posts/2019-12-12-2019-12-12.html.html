<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re staying warm today.  I&#8217;m excited
  that it&#8217;s a cold day today - yesterday my new pair of winter boots
  arrived in the mail.  I ordered them months ago, falling into the trap
  of ordering something on Amazon and not realizing the actual date it&#8217;s
  expected to arrive is months in the future.  Has that ever happened to
  you?  Marissa and I have even turned the boots into a joke.  &#8220;I love
  winter boots,&#8221; we say.  &#8220;Hope to be a part of them someday.&#8221;  Like a
  lot of our jokes, it&#8217;s tied to a deep <i>Office</i> reference.  So today,
  I&#8217;m attacking this Thursday, and looking forward to having warm feet.
  I love my black skate shoes, but they don&#8217;t do well in the winter.  At
  a certain point once they wear down, I might as well be wearing
  slippers.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  The theme of &#8220;dealing with
  confrontation&#8221; continued into talks with my boss and team, and it led
  to a really fruitful discussion.  I also learned that I have a
  tendency to apologize for disagreeing with people, which is definitely
  not how I saw myself, but since the thought entered my mind, more and
  more difficult conversations I&#8217;ve had in the past bubble up through my
  memory and fit the pattern.</p>
<p>In the late morning, I shut my laptop and the three of us took a
  little drive to the new Ian&#8217;s pizza that opened up in our
  neighborhood.  We&#8217;re tentatively trying that out as a new regular
  lunch spot.  They have good beer, but we&#8217;re still kind of all on the
  fence about the pizza.  &#8220;They have no middle ground,&#8221; Marissa
  complained.  &#8220;They&#8217;re either serving the most regular pizza possible,
  or something crazy and risky, like a pizza covered in Fritos.&#8221;  She
  gestured toward my order.  I had taken a risk on the chili cheese
  Frito pizza.  I ate the end and the crust, but decided to call a truce
  on the big middle portion of the slice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have to agree with her.  They have a lot of ambitious specialty
  pizzas, and undeniably some of those are real hits - the mac &amp; cheese
  quesadilla pizza is particularly noteworthy - but most of the time,
  their specialty pizzas are just slightly worse than the sum of its
  parts.  I&#8217;m reminded of the last time we went to Ian&#8217;s as a family,
  and I took a gamble on the thanksgiving pizza, which carried dark
  turkey meat, stuffing, and even some cranberry - slightly worse than
  the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>We head back home, and Rodney went down for a nap.  I worked from the
  couch for the rest of the day.  At quitting time, I shut my laptop,
  and joined Marissa on the couch.  Ziggy jumped up in my lap, and I
  nuzzled her into my chest.  We nodded off into a deep nap.  About a
  half hour later, I woke up from a terrible dream: I was scuba diving,
  and as I was trying to surface for air I realized I was surfacing too
  quickly and felt a tremendous pressure on my chest, which was actually
  just Ziggy, who had adjusted and was sleeping squarely on top of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was scared, because I remembered that when you surface from a deep
  dive, you have to do it slowly at an incline while exhaling or
  something,&#8221; I later described to Marissa.  &#8220;Your dreams are too
  technical,&#8221; she laughed.  It&#8217;s true - seems like even my daytime
  nightmares are always way too heavy on the details.</p>
<p>For dinner, we raided our own fridge for leftovers - garlic bread,
  potatoes, cheese, and leftover saucijzenbroodjes.  We discovered last
  night that they go really well with hot sauce.  Leftover night is fun,
  and gratifying.  It&#8217;s like a victory lap for all the meals you&#8217;ve had
  that week, and it feels good taking care of dinner without spending
  any money or leaving the house.  Not to mention it creates a lot of
  extra space in your fridge, and it feels good to use food.</p>
<p>We put Rodney to bed, then I started on my chores while Marissa worked
  on hers, stopping to chat between tasks.  While cleaning the fridge, I
  saw we had barely a splash of grapefruit juice left, so wanting to
  surprise Marissa with a snack, I tried to whip up some kind of
  grapefruit caramel.  But no matter how much sugar or butter I added,
  the dark &amp; twisted slurry just got darker and stranger, and when I
  finally called it and brought the bubbling, spurting caramel to the
  sink to cool it off with hot water, it congealed to an angry, greasy
  monkey fist.  The way it coalesced in the sink reminded me of the
  alien black suit from Spider-Man.  I put the hot dark mess in a bowl
  and walked it up to Marissa for her amusement.</p>
<p>Later, as we continued to tidy up together, Marissa walked over with a
  near empty sleeve of holiday-themed Starburst jelly beans.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t let
  me eat these again, I&#8217;m sick,&#8221; she said slipping them into the
  garbage.  &#8220;Are you basically addicted, and then you eat to much?&#8221;  I
  asked.  She nodded, and I replied, &#8220;Yep - eggnog.&#8221;  We bonded over our
  vices.  I&#8217;m a recovering eggnog addict.  I can&#8217;t even keep it in the
  house anymore.  When you think of eggnog around the holidays, you
  picture a cozy chair, some slippers, and a modest ounce of eggnog
  poured into a glass taster with some ground nutmeg on top, right?  For
  me, eggnog is just a shameful secret.  I swig it right out of the
  bottle with the fridge door still open, and like Marissa with her
  Starburst jelly beans, I drink too much at once, and I get sick.</p>
<p>We wrapped up our chores, then convened on the couch to advance a
  little further in <i>The Usual Suspects</i>.  It&#8217;s the kind of movie that
  has tempted us into staying up late and seeing it all the way through.
  Dense and nuanced, it&#8217;s difficult to pick back up the next day, so
  last night we had to practically rewind half of what we already saw to
  catch up.  I saw the movie already, and I feel like I&#8217;m finally
  piecing together the richer details of the plot for the first time on
  my second watch.  But what a movie, right?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Another week, another Thursday, and soon
  another weekend.  Hope you all have a great day today - and stay warm
  out there.</p>
