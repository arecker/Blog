<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re all staying warm out there.  This
  morning there is a little bit of snow on the ground, and all at once I
  realize how much some snow can affect your mood.  It has been so
  dreary outside lately, and after spending a whole weekend in the
  house, I&#8217;m looking forward to getting outside - even a short walk to
  the bus stop across the street sounds like a welcomed change of pace
  right now.</p>
<p>This weekend was pretty relaxing.  I certainly got my fill of hanging
  out with Rod and Marissa, catching up on chores, reading, and
  re-charging on the couch.  And this week of work is going to be busy.
  Looking at our family calendar, it&#8217;s evident we&#8217;re squeezing pretty
  much every evening this week, whether it&#8217;s our family Christmas photo,
  baking cookies, or finishing up Christmas presents before next week.
  I&#8217;m also on ticket duty, and on top of that I have to finish a pretty
  hefty standards document before this Friday.  &#8220;I basically have to
  write like a six page paper by the end of this week,&#8221; I griped to
  Marissa as we were going to bed.</p>
<p>With the busyness of this week, then immediate relief of time-off next
  week, I think I&#8217;m going to officially dub this week <i>the gauntlet</i>.
  It&#8217;s going to be a hectic one, but I think if I stay on track, divide
  my time up well, and stay motivated, we&#8217;ll be just fine.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a so-so day.  Obviously, the Bears losing to the Packers
  soured things.  The funny part about last night&#8217;s game was that even
  though we technically lost by more points than we did when we played
  the Packers in week 1, our performance was much less embarrassing than
  it was in week 1.  We let up a lot of points at the beginning, and it
  was clear our offense was trying to find a rhythm in the first half,
  but I think our boys put up a pretty good fight.  &#8220;Risky Trubisky&#8221;
  really showed up for this game.  If anything, last night Mitch
  confirmed his place as our starter for next season.  His hustle was
  undeniable, and I love how Mitch can keep plays alive.  He&#8217;s also
  freakishly accurate once he finds his focus.</p>
<p>In the end, Greenbay was just a better team this season.  I&#8217;m sure
  they have their own problems, and between you and me I don&#8217;t think
  they&#8217;re going to make it far into the playoffs, but they played the
  best in our division.  At least the Bears kept it interesting -
  keeping the score of this game within one touchdown and staying in
  playoff contention through week fifteen.  I emerge this season a
  proud, battered Bears fan with one season under my belt.  And there
  are still more games to go, so at least we&#8217;re not done watching
  football.</p>
<p>After the game, Marissa got back with the dogs carrying a handful of
  ribbons.  Both Ollie and Ziggy did really well this weekend.
  Yesterday, Ollie had two qualifying runs, and Ziggy had her first
  qualifying run in Open class.</p>
<p>After Marissa got home, I fried a batch of french fries, then made a
  half dozen polish sausages in foil with onions.  The meal didn&#8217;t turn
  out the way I&#8217;d have liked it.  I had trouble cooking the sausages all
  the way through - they stayed frozen, and I had to resort to the ol&#8217;
  &#8220;chuck it in the microwave&#8221; method, which never makes for good meat.
  On top of that, my hot dogs buns decided to fall apart, so I had to
  abandon steaming the buns.  At least the fries were good.  At least
  they were good, until I decided to warm them up in the oven, and they
  got a little soggy.  So last night&#8217;s dinner had some struggles, and
  even though inside I wanted to hurl a spatula at the wall and spike a
  plate on the ground, I kept my composure and resisted losing my
  temper.</p>
<p>It was a terrible dinner, though.  If we&#8217;re using 2019 Bears games as
  a grading rubric, this meal was probably like when the Bears played
  the Raiders in London.  Just a total breakdown of something that
  should have been pretty easy.</p>
<p>After dinner, I cleaned the kitchen and caught up on chores.  Last
  night, I came up with a pretty ingenious system to clean up oil.  Out
  of the last seven things I&#8217;ve tried, this is probably the first method
  I used that didn&#8217;t spill a single drop.  I simply took a gallon Ziploc
  bag and lined the inside of a tall Tupperware container.  I filled the
  bag over the sink, and while the bag only held half the oil, I was
  able to zip it up and use another to collect the rest.  When I
  finished pouring the oil, I used paper towels to soak up the rest in
  the pot, then I added the paper towels to the bag and zipped it shut.
  And with that, I had successfully moved about a half gallon of canola
  oil to the garbage without spilling a drop.  Here&#8217;s to small
  victories.</p>
<p>Marissa was napping on the couch as I cleaned.  As a joke, I decided
  to craft a snack menu for when she woke up.  The menu for <i>Rissa&#8217;s</i>
  included classic favorites like &#8220;cheese curbs&#8221;, &#8220;Rodney&#8217;s cookie&#8221;, and
  &#8220;Bring Me Three Clementines&#8221;.  That last one was a callback to a night
  where Marissa&#8217;s pregnancy was sending mixed cravings and she was
  trying to decide on what to eat.  She turned to me and said &#8220;bring me
  THREE clementines,&#8221; and she really emphasized the <i>three</i>.  Her
  uncertainty with <i>what</i> to eat and her emphasis on <i>how much</i> was
  funny, and it gave us a good laugh.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Now, I leave the comfort of my morning
  blogging station and head out into the breach.  Welcome to the
  gauntlet.  Five work days of ticket duty, technical standard writing,
  and evening work.  Let&#8217;s do this!  Happy Monday, everyone.  Let&#8217;s go
  hit this week!</p>
