<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re all doing well.  This morning,
  I&#8217;m having a lot of trouble waking up.  Yesterday was a pretty
  exhausting day.  I&#8217;m tired, and right now I would like nothing more
  than to just shut my eyes and slump in this chair.  I would probably
  sleep for an hour right here if I could.  I guess this is punishment
  for my gloating yesterday morning about how easy this week has
  been.  All things considered - (pause for a deep yawn) - this is
  fair.  I&#8217;m thinking when I get into work today, it could be a
  Starbucks morning.  Before I start this day, I&#8217;m going to test the
  limits of how many shots of espresso Starbucks is legally allowed to
  dispense to a single person.</p>
<p>This week, another foundation engineering team is visiting from San
  Francisco, and we dedicated yesterday to work with them.  We had some
  meetings in the morning, where we discussed some high level
  architecture decisions.  It was a pretty stimulating conversation.</p>
<p>For lunch, we took the team out to the Old Fashioned, padding the walk
  over and wait for food with the usual small talk about Madison,
  Wisconsin, and what it&#8217;s like to live here.  Our food took a long time
  to make it out of the kitchen, and while I was tempted to launch into
  my rant about mediocrity &amp; restaurants in Madison, I did my best to
  pump the breaks.  After lots of reflection, and armed with the new
  ideas in my Difficult Conversations book, I&#8217;m starting to question
  where that anger is coming from.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I sound like an ass when I do my whole &#8216;Madison restaurants&#8217;
  rant?&#8221; I asked Marissa later that night.  Marissa sheepishly smiled.
  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to answer that,&#8221; she said with as much grace and
  tact as possible.  Hearing that, I felt some shame.  I don&#8217;t like the
  idea of being a complainer.  My hope for this critique of our city&#8217;s
  food scene was that is was more nuanced than &#8220;Alex complains about
  restaurants,&#8221; but I&#8217;m starting to worry that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s getting
  through.  I think instead of trying to charge up the people around me
  to share my anger in frequently waiting too long for bar food, it
  might be time to lay down the sword and figure out where that anger is
  coming from.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe don&#8217;t talk to other people about it - you can talk about it
  with me,&#8221; Marissa clarified.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it works that way,&#8221; I
  said.  &#8220;If I talk about it with you, I&#8217;m just going to get excited
  about it again and it&#8217;s going to leak out,&#8221; I responded.</p>
<p>Following lunch, we split up into two groups using a bit of people
  from each team and did some problem workshops.  We set up some work
  before the visiting team arrived to take advantage of being in the
  same room as a team with which we normally only talk to remotely.  I
  worked with Oleg and Julia on upgrading some kubernetes servers, and
  everything pretty much went according to plan.</p>
<p>I took the bus home from work, and while walking up the driveway,
  Rodney happily greeted me at the window, pressing his face up against
  the glass.  Marissa was laughing at him sitting at the dining room
  table.  Rodney opened the door and immediately took my hand and led me
  into the house, as if I was a visiting friend.  &#8220;He&#8217;s in a really good
  mood today,&#8221; Marissa said.  I could imagine that after a week and a
  half of fevers, a runny nose, and terrible sleep, Rodney was due for a
  good day.  It was clear that his energy was back, and he was elated to
  have a regular day.  &#8220;Do you want to go to the grocery store?&#8221; I asked
  kneeling down to meet his eyes.  &#8220;Leeeet&#8217;s DO IT,&#8221; Rodney said pumping
  his fist.</p>
<p>At the grocery store, Rodney continued to let his good mood radiate,
  wishing almost every person we walked by his trademarked &#8220;Happy
  Holidays!&#8221;  I rewarded his shopping work ethic with a chocolate egg,
  which he happily unwrapped at home.  I cooked hutspot and some
  sausages while he worked on a puzzle at the table.</p>
<p>After dinner, I gave Rodney a bath, then Marissa and I reported to the
  kitchen for &#8220;baking hell day&#8221; as we have been calling it.  We were
  each going to make double batches of, respectively, Oatmeal
  butterscotch cookies and palmiers.  We worked in the kitchen the rest
  of the music, baking, chatting, and joking about the endless toil
  around baking in general.  &#8220;We could open up a bakery around this
  concept - just being reluctant and grumpy about everything we make,&#8221; I
  joked.</p>
<p>We finally closed the kitchen just before midnight, and making the
  decision to trade in some sleep for time on the couch, I poured a
  drink and slumped over in front of the TV with Marissa.  By the time
  we had watched a couple of YouTube videos, my eyes started to grow
  heavy and we retreated upstairs.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;m heading into the office, and I&#8217;m trying to get in a
  writing mindset.  That technical paper I was supposed to be working on
  all week remains practically untouched, so today the plan is to find a
  quiet corner and write as if my life depended on it, breaking only for
  some leftover hutspot.  I think I can knock the whole thing out
  today.  Technical writing is difficult, but it doesn&#8217;t squeeze your
  mind dry the same way that creative writing does.  There&#8217;s no danger
  in writing too much and churning out drivel - either your technical
  paper accurately and concisely describes the solution, or it doesn&#8217;t
  and you have to rewrite the sentences that are not clear.  I may call
  on the help from several cups of coffee, but we&#8217;ll get it done.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  I hope you have a wonderful day, and as
  always, thanks for reading.  Happy Wednesday, everyone.</p>
