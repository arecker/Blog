<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re all having a wonderful day.  At
  the moment, we&#8217;re barreling down the interstate highway bound for our
  home in Madison Wisconsin.  Icy rain is gently rapping the windshield,
  &#8220;New Body&#8221; by Kanye West is quietly thumping through the car speakers,
  and Rodney is in the back seat man handling a blueberry donut like it
  owes him money.  Marissa kindly agreed to drive the first leg of the
  journey so I could write.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t sleep great last night, but that was probably my doing.  To
  celebrate our last night in Minnesota with Marissa&#8217;s family, I sort of
  opened the throttle on the pizza, snacks, and beer.  So I had a
  difficult time rolling out of bed this morning, but thinking ahead at
  the warm cup of coffee waiting for me at the Caribou drive-through, I
  persevered.  We packed the car, said our goodbyes, and left this
  morning around 9:30.  Something tells me that I just need to unpack
  and have a nice bowl of soup, so the plan is to pick up some groceries
  at Hy-Vee and whip up a leak and potato soup for dinner.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day.  We lounged around the house all
  morning drinking coffee, and when we finally got hungry enough, we
  jumped in the car to grab some Chipotle.  Walking all the way up to
  the door, we stopped in our tracks - &#8220;Closed&#8221;.  Marissa called her
  parents, who were parking the car.  As they discussed a back up plan,
  I obnoxiously hush-shouted <i>Pho</i> into Marissa&#8217;s ear.  She laughed, and
  added &#8220;Alex is really excited about that Pho place&#8230; OK see ya
  there.&#8221;  Hearing that it was actually happening, I started to get
  excited for our suddenly adventurous lunch.  I was referring to this
  little Vietnamese restaurant in Rochester that is right off one of the
  busier roads.  Despite it&#8217;s unimaginative black-on-white signage that
  just reads <i>PHO THAI</i>, I insisted that it was promising.  &#8220;I have a
  good feeling about that place,&#8221; I&#8217;d say while passing it, wagging my
  finger out the window.  So needless to say, this was a pretty big day
  for me.  We would finally put my restaurant instinct to the test.</p>
<p>We sat in the middle of a dining room, and to my relief, they were
  busy.  Very busy.  That&#8217;s the first good sign of a restaurant.  But
  despite the bustling dining room, we were quickly served drinks.  We
  ordered some egg rolls for Rodney, then glancing over the menu, the
  beef rice noodle soup caught my eye.  &#8220;Is it spicy?  I&#8217;m kind of just
  looking to flush my system here,&#8221; I said to the waiter gesturing at my
  nose.  &#8220;It can be as spicy as you want, you can just add chili oil,&#8221;
  he said directing my attention to a small jar and spoon set out on the
  table.  According to the menu, the beef rice noodle soup had slices of
  steak and chunks of beef tendon, which honestly sounded so weird that
  I had to try it.  Ten minutes later, the waiter lowered what looked
  like bucket of soup in front of me.  Steam was billowing from the pale
  yellow broth, and giving it quick stir showed thin, delicate slices of
  beef, green onions, and what looked like a birds nest of beautiful
  white rice noodles.</p>
<p>After cutting up Rodney&#8217;s food, I beckoned for the jar of chili oil,
  and generously dabbed my soup with the miniature spoon.  The deep red
  oil beaded and rolled around the surface.</p>
<p>The soup tasted glorious.  My nose started to run, which garnered some
  teasing from the table, but it was exactly what I needed.  As my nose
  ran, I could feel my sinuses flood with fresh air as the beef broth
  warmed me from the inside out.</p>
<p>Digging around with some chopsticks, I found a small chunk of meat,
  but it was ghostly white.  &#8220;Ah, this must be the beef tendon,&#8221; I said
  holding it up.  Marissa looked at me in horror as I closed my eyes and
  chewed it.  It tasted like a fatty piece of gristle, only it melted in
  my mouth without chewing.</p>
<p>In short, <i>Pho Thai</i> was an experience.  And as far as meals go, it
  was probably the highlight of my week.  Maybe I&#8217;m biased, wanting to
  prove my new restaurant instincts as worthy.</p>
<p>We returned home and Grandma Mary visited.  She dropped off some
  Lincoln logs for Rodney, and she gave me a pair of warm rubber soled
  socks.  &#8220;Are they too small?&#8221; she asked with concern as I squeezed my
  big feet into the fuzzy sheath.  &#8220;Nah, they&#8217;re awesome!  Look at me, I
  look like a sherpa!&#8221; I happily replied.</p>
<p>We said farewell to Grandma Mary, and Rodney, Marissa, and I retreated
  into our bedroom for a long afternoon nap.  The beef noodle soup was
  still resting comfortably in my stomach, and to not capitalize on the
  lunch with a nap would feel like sacrilege.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was pretty low key.  We ordered a pizza, and after
  putting Rodney to bed, Marissa and I watched animal planet and played
  cards until we couldn&#8217;t stay awake.  It was a fun way to unwind after
  a long trip.</p>
<p>After seeing family on both sides across three states, we&#8217;re tired,
  but our heart is full, and we&#8217;re feeling proud to have finished our
  hectic holiday week in one piece.  I&#8217;m thinking about my couch, a bowl
  of soup, and my dogs.</p>
<p>We have a day to recoup, then Marissa&#8217;s sister and - as of yesterday -
  her brand new fiance will be staying with us until New Year&#8217;s Eve.  As
  Marissa and I played cards last night, we planned out some meals, and
  I think the Recker kitchen is really going to bring the heat.  Justin,
  if you&#8217;re reading this, you had better come hungry.  We&#8217;re going to
  test the limits of what you claim is an iron-cast bottomless stomach.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, everyone.  Wherever you are, hope you find time
  today to recoup after the holidays.  Even if you have to recoup in the
  car.  There&#8217;s still something comforting about an empty, cold highway,
  isn&#8217;t there?</p>
