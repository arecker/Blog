<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p><i>Goedemorgen</i>, everyone.  I hope this Monday finds you well.  This
  morning, I&#8217;m just about as cozy as possible, and it took a bit of work
  to get here.  Justin and Megan are sleeping in the living room, and
  fearing that Ziggy would jump on the cot or the couch and start
  uncontrollably kissing them, I had to carry her through the living
  room.  After unlocking the gate and tip-toeing by with Ziggy on my
  hip, I brewed a whole pot of coffee, started a load of dishes, then in
  batches returned some coffee travelers and the dogs back into our
  bedroom and shut the door.</p>
<p>So after feeding both dogs and taking two hushed trips up the stairs,
  I&#8217;m back in my bedroom with the door closed, and the dogs are back in
  bed with momma.  And seeing the empty bottle of Southern Comfort in
  our kitchen, I have a feeling that Megan and Justin would appreciate
  the extra care in not waking them up too early.</p>
<p><i>Sip</i>.  I&#8217;m hanging in there, readers.  But I&#8217;m not going to lie to
  you, I&#8217;m kind of a pathetic site this morning.  My nose is running.
  I&#8217;ve been permanently wearing the same hoodie and pair of sweats for
  two days.  Today, the name of the game is getting through Monday.  I
  have only one day to work before I take off again for New Year&#8217;s Eve
  and New Year&#8217;s Day (both apostrophes are intentional).  I&#8217;m working
  from home, in an effort to keep my cold away from the rest of the team
  at work, and they appreciated that.  &#8220;I&#8217;m working from home too,&#8221;
  replied my coworker in our team slack.  &#8220;Using Recker&#8217;s all holidays
  toothbrush really backfired on me.&#8221;  He was joking, of course.  For
  all intents and purposes, my coworker Alex has his own toothbrush.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the movie Moon?  Without spoiling too much of the
  movie, Sam Rockwell plays two versions of an astronaut sent to live on
  the moon and serve a seven year stint managing some kind of moon rock
  harvesting station.  There is a version of him in the movie when he
  first got to the moon - healthy, stubborn, and restless - and a
  version of him at the end of his seven year stint - sick &amp; weak, but
  patient and persistent.</p>
<p>Last night as I was drifting off to sleep, I pictured two versions of
  myself.  One of them was beginning 2019.  He was energetic and
  optimistic, but had a lot of unsolved issues with anger, and it made
  him a bit restless.  But he was just discovering how good it felt to
  cook and clean, and he was eager build that into his personality.  The
  other version of me was ending 2019 - sniffling, sneezing, still
  exhausted from traveling, but more patient and persistent.  Still
  getting the dishes washed, clothes folded, food on the table - still
  getting the job done.  I think at this point I&#8217;ve spoon-fed you the
  metaphor.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m hanging in there.  I&#8217;m actually looking forward to this
  evening - we&#8217;ve promised Justin and Megan that we&#8217;d make a campfire
  outside, and we&#8217;ve promised Rodney that we would take Justin and Megan
  bowling.  And as long as we&#8217;ve got Dayquil and Nyquil stocked in the
  medicine cabinet, I&#8217;m game for both.</p>
<p>Yesterday turned out to be a pretty good day.  Marissa left in the
  late morning for agility, and Rodney and I hung around the house.  I
  played the Bears game in the dining room while Rodney sat at his train
  table, occasionally strolling into the kitchen to check on what I was
  doing.  I baked a big batch of saucijzenbroodjes, then heated up some
  soup for lunch.  By the time Rodney went down for a nap in the
  afternoon, the Bears had eeked out a victory over the Vikings, which
  aside from nominally sparing us of shame of a losing season (we ended
  8-8), amounted to nothing.  In fact, the Vikings played their second
  string most of the time, treating this as an unofficial bye week
  before their turn in the playoffs.  And that made everything good the
  Bears did feel gross, whether it was Monty&#8217;s pile-moving touchdown,
  Kwit&#8217;s safety, or Pineiro&#8217;s game winning field goal.  So congrats us -
  we barely beat the Viking&#8217;s reserve of backup players, most of which
  hadn&#8217;t set foot on the field all season.</p>
<p>After the game, I tried to take a nap, but it didn&#8217;t stick.  Rodney
  was thumping around and rambling to himself in his room, and it was
  too amusing to sleep.  I finally called it quits around 4:30 and
  returned to the kitchen to prep dinner.  Justin and Megan rolled in
  around five, and after greeting them at the door and setting them up
  with some drinks and broodjes, I got Rodney from upstairs.  He handled
  most of the entertaining while I finished prepping dinner.  From what
  I could hear, he took Megan and Justin through an itemized recap his
  new toys.</p>
<p>Shortly after Marissa returned home with Ziggy, we ate dinner.  Kale
  salad with Greek lemon-garlic chicken &amp; potatoes.  We also shared a
  bottle of champagne to celebrate Megan and Justin&#8217;s engagement.  I
  made them wait until Marissa got home before they told the story.
  &#8220;Marissa will know what questions to ask,&#8221; I jeered.  &#8220;If you tell it
  to me, it&#8217;s just gonna be a lot of &#8216;OK then what happened&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>After dinner, we moved to the family room for what will probably be
  the last Christmas present opening ceremony of the Christmas season.
  Megan and Justin got Rodney some toys from both his current favorite
  TV shows, and a geode.  Using a tupperware lid and a hammer, Marissa
  cracked the geode in half, revealing its shimmery center - a Christmas
  gift that&#8217;s also a memorable activity.  Pretty good, right?  Megan and
  Justin bought us a Taco T-rex (a plastic dinosaur that props of tacos
  while you dress them), as well as a cookbook and a French chef&#8217;s hat.
  Even though I was all done cooking for the night, I still wore the hat
  while I finished cleaning.  I have to admit, I felt distinguished.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  As I was writing this entry, making it
  further into this cup of coffee, I think I&#8217;m finally starting to perk
  up.  I think I finally have the mental energy to bust out my laptop
  and work.  If we&#8217;re still pretending 2019 is the movie <i>Moon</i>, with
  only two days to go, it&#8217;s safe to say I&#8217;m on my belly wrapped in a
  space blanket, inching closer and closer to the escape pod.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great day, everyone.  Thanks for reading.</p>
