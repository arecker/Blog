<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing well today.  To set the
  scene here, the smell of bacon &amp; slightly burnt butter lingers in the
  kitchen.  Breakfast debris litters the dining room table.  Justin and
  Megan can be overheard in our living room chatting and packing up
  their things.  Marissa sits slumped over still in her chair from
  Breakfast, glaring at me with tired puppy dog eyes.  &#8220;Are you ready
  for errand day?&#8221; I tease.</p>
<p>Despite being on the third day of my cold, I&#8217;m actually feeling pretty
  good.  I&#8217;ve entered into the very silly chain-sneezing stage of
  things.  And can I be honest?  Sneezing is pretty fun.  I&#8217;m not
  talking about the polite kind where you muffle it in your jacket or
  elbow, then as obligated by society, you have to convince everyone
  with Joaquin Phoenix acting that absolutely nothing came out of your
  nose.  I&#8217;m talking about the kind of sneezes where you are by yourself
  in your bedroom, or maybe about to jump into the shower, and not only
  can you sneeze without covering your mouth, but you can also put your
  back into it.  I guess In Rodney&#8217;s case, where he hasn&#8217;t yet learned
  about the social stigma of runny dangling boogers, that&#8217;s just about
  every sneeze for him.  And you have to envy that.  This weekend, I&#8217;m
  also thinking about Justin and Megan.  The three of us Reckers have
  been practically sneezing all over the place, and I hate the thought
  of helping this stupid little cold propagate.  If they make it out of
  this house without a cold, you can count me amazed.</p>
<p>OK, there&#8217;s probably an unspoken rule where you can spend more than a
  paragraph talking about boogers, so let&#8217;s transition, shall we?
  Yesterday was a pretty great day.  I worked from home and kept things
  pretty mellow.  Marissa took Megan and Justin to her dog agility
  seminar in the afternoon while Rodney screwed around in the living
  room.  To his advantage, I spaced out and didn&#8217;t remember his 2:30 nap
  until 3:30.  By the time I glanced up from my laptop, Rodney was
  standing aimlessly in the living room wearing my headphones, his
  construction goggles, and holding his Nerf gun.</p>
<p>Rodney slept, and soon Marissa returned home with her kin.  After
  making a quick run to Hy-Vee to stock up on breakfast supplies, we
  went out to Mr. Brew&#8217;s.  That was the place we selected after a
  tumultuous deliberation on eat out places.  Picking a place to eat is
  challenging because Marissa and I seemingly have a horror story for
  just about every restaurant around us, and even more so if we&#8217;re
  talking about the restaurants that are actually open on Monday
  evening.  But Mr. Brew&#8217;s is a solid choice, as long as I steer clear
  of their <i>Peanut Buster Burger</i> - which I did.  We finished eating and
  left just as their trivia night started.</p>
<p>Next stop was bowling.  We parked at the <i>Dream Lanes</i>, got some
  shoes, and started chucking balls.  We only had time for one game
  before Rodney&#8217;s bed time, but sharing in Rodney&#8217;s enthusiasm each time
  he knocked over even a single pin made for a full experience.  I also
  must have played the best game of my life last night.  For someone who
  can barely bowl over 80 most nights, you can imagine how surprised I
  was to bowl a 116 (citation pending, I was actually too excited to
  remember my exact score).  Throughout the game, Justin and I enjoyed a
  Spotted Cow from the bar, which if you step back and judge fairly, is
  probably the best beer to bowl with.</p>
<p>On the way out, Auntie Megan slipped Rodney some change so he could
  buy a toy from the vending machine.  The first toy that came out was
  an LA Chargers plastic football.  He glanced at the toy, and
  immediately put it back in the chute, moving to the next machine with
  two more quarters financed by his kind auntie.  This time, it yielded
  a sticky hand, and that was good enough to leave.</p>
<p>When we got home, Rodney went to bed, and the four of us crashed on
  the couch with some snacks to watch the rest of Joker.  Having an hour
  left to watch before turning in for the night yesterday, we were all
  pretty pleased with the movie.  &#8220;That&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t bad,&#8221; I said offering a
  passing review.  &#8220;The love story felt a little wedged in, but Joaquin
  kind of carries the movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well picking up where we left off, the movie took a real nose dive.
  As the movie marched on with long gratuitous establishing shots of
  Joaquin dancing around weirdly in his apartment (which was also a
  blatant rip-off of taxi driver), the plot holes abounded, and then at
  the end of the movie (spoiler coming), they hit you with the old <i>he&#8217;s
  insane and most of this probably wasn&#8217;t real</i> trick.  The film
  continues to meander until the climax, where Joaquin magically incites
  an angry, murderous riot with a stammering speech that sounded cobbled
  together from unrelated <i>Bullet for My Valentine</i> lyrics - the kind of
  stuff you&#8217;d write on your notebook in ninth grade with a really dark
  black gel pen.  Not to mention he somehow got on the Late Show by
  appearing in a viral video.  It&#8217;s the 80s.  There&#8217;s no YouTube,
  Facebook, or Twitter.  Are we supposed to believe the VHS tape of him
  flopping at a comedy club was copied and distributed so rampantly that
  he was asked to appear on the Late Show?</p>
<p>To sum up, <i>Joker</i> was a bad movie, and it wasn&#8217;t even bad in the fun
  way.  We rounded off the night by watching an episode of Seinfeld.  I
  picked Season Nine&#8217;s <i>The Merv Griffin Show</i>, which weirdly enough fit
  with the theme of the Joker.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Going forward, our New Year&#8217;s Even will
  be finally putting the house back together, taking down Christmas
  lights, and hopefully watching a better movie than <i>Joker</i>.  And who
  knows, maybe I&#8217;ll even take a shower.  Caught up the hustle of
  traveling and hospitality, I&#8217;ve missed a few days and I&#8217;ve gotten to
  the point where I&#8217;m afraid to take my yellow beanie off.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful New Year&#8217;s eve.  I suppose I should
  take some time to reflect on all the journal entries I&#8217;ve completed.
  Expect that soon - but not now.  Cleaning now - thinking &amp; reflecting
  later.</p>
