<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing well today.  This morning,
  it feels good to get back into the swing of things - quietly sneaking
  downstairs to make coffee, showering, and digging clean clothes out of
  my laundry bin.  We&#8217;ve entered into the &#8216;early morning nuisance&#8217; stage
  of this cold, so although it&#8217;s not pleasant, it&#8217;s definitely
  surmountable.</p>
<p><i>Sip</i>.  Even though I&#8217;m a little tired this morning, I&#8217;m feeling
  pretty good.  Yesterday, Marissa and I spent most of the evening
  attacking chores and projects.  Speaking for both of us, I think we&#8217;re
  about 80% caught up with our chores.  Looking back, January has always
  been kind of a cleaning &amp; project month for us, and with new baby
  Miles coming in the late spring, I expect to really step it up with
  the help of nesting instincts.  This year, we&#8217;re testing out a new
  three column whiteboard &amp; index card system, and if it works out,
  you&#8217;ll hear more details later.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  Of all times and places to kick off
  the new decade, our family chose 12:30 at Denny&#8217;s, and to our
  surprise, it was a pretty good experience.  Our pancakes and coffee
  actually came out so quickly, we found it startling.  Sitting at
  Denny&#8217;s, we talked through the handful of errands we had to run -
  Target, Hobby Lobby, Office Max, and Bed Bath and Beyond.  Aided by a
  healthy American grand slam breakfast, we cruised through all of them
  and returned home in the afternoon.  We fixed Rodney a pre-nap PB&amp;J,
  set up our new project board, then took a short break.  Marissa caught
  a nap on the couch while I played some Splinter Cell.  The rest of the
  evening was leftovers, bedtime, and work.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little moment of Zen from yesterday.  Before putting Rod to
  bed, I noticed his backup sheets were in the hamper, so I moved his
  dirty laundry bin to the hallway, then changed Rodney into some
  pajamas.  Some minutes later, we were in bed reading a story, and
  Marissa wandered in to see what we were doing.  From the corner of my
  eye, I saw her folding laundry in front of Rodney&#8217;s closet.  Finally
  after about five minutes of reading Rodney&#8217;s Bible story, I earmarked
  the page and looked up - &#8220;is that Rodney&#8217;s laundry?&#8221; I asked.  Marissa
  dutifully nodded.  I grimaced.  &#8220;That bin in the hallway was dirty
  clothes,&#8221; I said.  Marissa stopped mid-folding to think.  &#8220;I was
  wondering why just <i>some</i> of these pants were still wet,&#8221; she said as
  my grimace widened.  She reluctantly picked out all the soiled clothes
  she had put away.</p>
<p>Later that night, we found ourselves in the basement putting away
  Christmas lights.  Marissa had four seasonal decoration bins total -
  three for Christmas and one for fall, and she insisted that all four
  should fit on the shelf in the back basement.  I claimed only three
  would fit, and one would have to spend the summer on the floor, so she
  joined be downstairs to educate me.  As she was grunting, pinning a
  large tupperware bin between her hip and the water heater all while
  her neck crooked to avoid hitting her head on a cold metal duct, I
  broke out in laughter.  &#8220;Our basement gives me anxiety,&#8221; I said aloud,
  quoting something she admitted earlier in the evening while we were
  making home project cards.  The box finally slid into place, and
  Marissa and I clambered through boxes, sawdust, and under the
  hazardous low ceiling.  We passed by the washing machine, which was
  violently shaking and had take a lunge forward off its flimsy wheels.
  Marissa and I broke out into more laughter.  &#8220;This is the worst
  basement ever,&#8221; she said.  I nodded - &#8220;it&#8217;s literally a nightmare.
  Our house is built on a foundation of anxiety,&#8221; I pontificated as we
  trudged up the stairs.</p>
<p>Later that night, I promised to dedicate my entire journal entry to
  how terrible our basement was.  It probably wouldn&#8217;t take an entire
  morning entry to get my point across, but most weeks it really does
  seem like all the unfinished work pools downstairs like a swamp of
  procrastination.  There&#8217;s a fifty foot ethernet cable spooled in the
  corner.  The washer and dryer shake and wander away from their
  designated position.  There&#8217;s an ad hoc packaging station set up in
  the corner with empty card board boxes, and we&#8217;ve started referring to
  it as <i>the shanty town</i>.  Marissa&#8217;s resin tent stands in the center,
  suspended from the ceiling with tape and string in a way that both of
  us have forgotten how to ever do again.</p>
<p>I feel hopeful for our basement.  I&#8217;m hopeful for how productive we
  feel in January, and I&#8217;m hopeful that with the nesting instincts,
  together we&#8217;ll rage against our least favorite room in the house and
  turn it into something we&#8217;re proud of.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  In a few minutes, I&#8217;ll jump out of my
  room and catch a bus to work, where my new laptop is hopefully
  waiting.  Setting up a new laptop is kind of exciting.  It&#8217;s a chance
  to wipe the slate clean, forever leaving the forgotten programs and
  deprectated configuration files on my old laptop.  And it will feel
  good to wipe the slate - who doesn&#8217;t like that?  I unintentionally
  picked a great time to start fresh, the spring cleaning vibes are
  strong with this month, and I hope they produce some good results.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today, and that you march into your
  basement, shed, garage, or whatever room gives you the most anxiety
  with the cleaning fury of two nesting parents.</p>
