<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Friday to everyone out there.  We&#8217;re
  now officially done with the first work week of 2020, so give yourself
  a pat on the back if you&#8217;re out there and you made it.  It&#8217;s not the
  first complete week of the year.  For me, it was barely a half week,
  and it was a struggle to get through.  Marissa and I are still
  afflicted with colds, and mine has even made a bit of a resurgence.
  This cold is like a Bruno Mars song - the moment I said &#8220;hey I thing
  we&#8217;re all done with this&#8221;, there it is on the radio again back in full
  force.  So I&#8217;m feeling a little tired this morning, my nose is runny,
  but I&#8217;m still showered, dressed, and ready to rock.</p>
<p>I hit the chores pretty hard yesterday.  I attacked another project on
  our board, this time gutting my closet of unneeded IT supplies.  The
  other day, Rodney was playing in my bin, and I lost track of what he
  was doing, and just about every little plug, dongle and cable was
  dumped out and scattered on the floor.  I love it when he plays in my
  stuff - I think that&#8217;s important - but usually I intervene before it
  gets to the <i>just dump everything out</i> phase of playtime.  But rather
  than spending a half hour meticulously putting everything back into
  place, I just crammed it all willy nilly into the bin and decided to
  go through it later.</p>
<p>So last night, I finally had time to sort it all out.  Ironically, the
  process of cleaning out my bin looked a lot like what Rodney was
  doing - dump everything out.  It took me about an hour to sort, label,
  and bag all the spare parts, and it felt great.  Luckily, I set up a
  pretty good system for organizing it sometime last year, and the
  system continues to work.</p>
<p>In other news, last night&#8217;s dinner was a spectacular failure, so for
  your amusement, let me take you through it.  Picture this - the goal
  was a half sandwich and a cup of soup.  Right off the bat, it sounds a
  little lunchy and light, but realistically I just wanted to make a
  simple soup with a more involved sandwich and serve them together.  I
  went with the classic Monte Cristo and a butternut squash soup.</p>
<p>The Monte Cristo is basically just a ham and cheese melted onto french
  toast.  It&#8217;s assembled on some whitebread, dipped into a savory
  batter, and fried nice and crispy in butter.  As I was mixing the
  improvised batter and assembling the sandwich, I started to feel
  pretty good about it.  Everything smelled great, and miraculously I
  had managed to get a squash peeled, sliced, roasted, and simmering in
  soup base by 6:30, so I was looking great for time.  But I made a
  critical mistake.  In all the videos I watched, best practices
  recommended toasting the bread before dipping it in the batter.  This
  would make it drier, more prone to soak up batter, and more likely to
  come out crispy and delicious.  But I didn&#8217;t do this step.  Instead, I
  dipped the soft white bread right into the eggs and took them straight
  to cast iron.  It made a convincing sizzle at first, but as it cooked,
  it just started to look like regular soft and plushy french toast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the soup front, the squash tenderized beautifully, and
  after hitting it with the immersion blender, the consistency was
  velvety and satisfying.  Here is where I made my first mistake, I
  dumped in a whole container of whipping cream.  &#8220;This won&#8217;t affect the
  consistency too much,&#8221; I thought.  &#8220;It&#8217;s just cream.&#8221;  Well, Alex,
  cream is a liquid too, and adding the whole carton of cream thinned
  the soup, and the result looked like a weird orange latte that frankly
  didn&#8217;t taste like squash anymore.  So with the soup ruined in a swift
  motion, my hope was on the sandwiches.</p>
<p>I had decided to fry all three at the same time, so if no crisypness
  was happening before, it definitely wasn&#8217;t happening now.  With the
  pan crowded with three sandwiches, the brown color was there from the
  butter, but the cheese barely melted.  I dusted the wet, warm
  sandwiches with powdered sugar - a little too much.  Ah, and the icing
  on the cake was the soup garnish.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll jazz it up with a few
  sunflower seeds,&#8221; I thought.  I sprinkled some seeds onto Marissa&#8217;s
  soup.  And you know how denser things always float to the bottom of a
  liquid?  The soup was so thin that the seeds plopped to the bottom.  A
  nice little surprise waiting at the bottom of the bowl if you&#8217;re brave
  enough to finish it.</p>
<p>So sandwich and soup night was a learning failure.  But if we&#8217;re
  honest, it was doomed from the start.  A Monte Cristo sandwich is
  much &#8220;brunchy-er&#8221; than I expected, and it made for a weird pairing
  with a fall soup - or squash flavored milk.</p>
<p>Even though dinner didn&#8217;t turn out great, it was still a fun exercise.
  I think the next stage of learning to cook is starting with ideas
  instead of explicit recipes.  There was probably nothing that would
  have saved the sandwiches, but being the only one to taste the soup
  before I ruined it, the soup was promising.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll eat anything weird,
  as long as you&#8217;re learning and experimenting,&#8221; said Marissa commending
  me.</p>
<p><i>Sip</i>.  Busy week.  I&#8217;m really looking forward to the weekend.  It
  sounds ridiculous that I&#8217;d be tired from only working two three days
  this week, but my body doesn&#8217;t lie.  Tonight, we&#8217;re hanging around the
  house &amp; making a pizza.  Tomorrow, Rodney got us excited about going
  bowling.  &#8220;There should be more bowling in our lives&#8221; is the closest
  thing our family has to a New Year&#8217;s Resolution this year, so we&#8217;re
  putting it to work on the first weekend of the year.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  Take care of yourself today.  You probably
  got ambitions for the year, and if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;re in a hurry
  to make 2020 as cool of a year as it sounds, but let&#8217;s make a
  resolution now to take our time and let 2020 develop it&#8217;s own mood.</p>
<p>Have a great Friday, everyone.</p>
