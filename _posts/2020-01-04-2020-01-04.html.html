<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Saturday.  Hope you&#8217;re feeling good,
  and ready to make the most of the weekend - or not, that&#8217;s just fine
  too.  We chose to sleep in a bit this morning, and I spent the morning
  drinking coffee, listening to music, and making French toast.  Let me
  tell you, every time I make French toast with my little nonstick pan,
  I fall a little more in love with nonstick.  I don&#8217;t know why I was so
  against the idea at first, but it&#8217;s clear to me now that nonstick is
  the apex predator of frying things in butter.  Cast iron has worked
  fine more me in the past, but it takes too long to heat up, and by the
  time it&#8217;s hot, it just wants to keep getting hotter and will likely
  burn your butter.</p>
<p>So this morning, we were all sitting around the table eating breakfast
  and chatting.  To our great amusement, we sat for a while in silence
  just watching Rodney wolf down four strips of bacon.  He&#8217;s hitting a
  growth spurt - we&#8217;ve noticed he&#8217;s saying newer phrases, a little
  better at talking, and starting to eat more and ask for different
  foods.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a funny Rodney story that I forgot to share.  On New Year&#8217;s
  day, I was getting him out of bed and doing my best to explain New
  Year&#8217;s, resolutions, and what the holiday means.  As I was getting him
  ready for the day, I posed the question &#8220;Do you have a New Year&#8217;s
  resolution?&#8221;  Rodney paused for a long time, and I started to get
  excited, thinking he would have a meaningful, thoughtful answer.
  &#8220;Peanut butter and jelly,&#8221; he said breaking his thought.  &#8220;Cut in
  triangles.&#8221;  I ask Rodney a lot of questions, but I&#8217;ve started to
  suspect that when he doesn&#8217;t understand what I&#8217;m talking about, he
  just assumes I&#8217;m asking him what he wants for lunch.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about some more Rodney silliness, shall we?  Last night, we
  decided to watch some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItMpKIxXwlw">Dude Perfect Trick Shots</a> while Marissa was
  cutting Rodney&#8217;s hair.  He really took to the idea, and afterwards he
  spent a half hour running around doing <i>trick shocks</i>.  &#8220;HOCKEY TRICK
  SHOCK,&#8221; he&#8217;d yell as he&#8217;d run over to grab his tiny plastic hockey
  stick and ball.  He&#8217;s wind up and swing, knocking the ball a few feet,
  then take off in a circle with his arms extended yelling <i>LEEEEEET&#8217;S
  GOOOOOO</i>.  Marissa and I have been regular watchers of Dude Perfect
  for a while, and it was only a matter of time before it became a
  family affair.  If you&#8217;re uninitiated, I&#8217;d check it out.  They&#8217;re the
  kind of guys that you wish you could hate, but they&#8217;re so likable and
  silly, and you can&#8217;t help but envy that their day job is pretty much
  just playing with Nerf Guns, jet skis, and ping pong balls.</p>
<p><i>Sip</i>.  The coffee is good today.  This morning I brewed a separate
  pot of that tequila infused coffee I got for Christmas.  It packs a
  pleasant caffeine buzz, and the aftertaste of tequila in the morning
  is actually kind of mysterious and intriguing.</p>
<p>So yesterday was a pretty great day.  I spent the morning quietly
  writing, wrapping up my work for the week, and putting the final
  touches on my new work laptop.  I finally got upgraded to one of those
  Macbook Pros with the fancy touch bar.  I use my own separate
  keyboard, so it really doesn&#8217;t bother me.  Actually, the flickering
  touch bar makes me look busier when I work.  When I type, it flashes
  word suggestions on the screen, and I like how the brightness and
  volume buttons morph into a slider when you press them.  I know longer
  have an actual power button, which is a bummer.  Especially since the
  alternative is apparently just mashing my trackpad and enter key until
  the computer decides to wake up.  It&#8217;s never even clear to me if it&#8217;s
  turned off or just sleeping.  Who asks for these things?  If you ask
  me, turning a piece of equipment on and off is the most fundamental
  interaction.  Why do newer computers treat this like an afterthought?</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon got a little rough.  Continuing work after lunch,
  my back started to get a little tight, and I feared a back spasm was
  coming on.  I drank a glass of water, then retreated into the Ki Gong
  room to stretch and lay on my back for a half hour.  Luckily, the pain
  subsided, but one spasm and one near-spasm in the same week is kind of
  troubling.  Before this week, I hadn&#8217;t had a spasm in several months.
  I stopped occupational therapy, assuming the problem disappeared.  But
  now the thought of picking that all up again, doing stretches, and
  scheduling appointments is kind of exhausting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet it was playing Splinter Cell,&#8221; I said last night, thinking
  aloud while Marissa was in the dining room.  &#8220;I always have terrible
  posture when I play that game, and I had two long playing sessions
  when we got home.&#8221;  Marissa nodded.</p>
<p>I remember back when the therapist described to me the problem of
  nerve inflammation, and how if it got worse, it would require surgery
  to pluck the nerves up like a guitar string and move them to the other
  side of my elbows.  The thought makes me shudder, and I hope it
  doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p><i>Sip</i>.  It feels nice to have an empty weekend.  Today, I&#8217;m going to
  take down the Christmas lights while Rodney plays outside.  I&#8217;m going
  to try to get the last of my 2019 mixtapes in the mail.  In the
  evening, we&#8217;re going to go bowling.  Hey - we have to make time for
  it.  In 2020, we committed to being a bowling family, and this family
  takes our commitments seriously.  Sure - it&#8217;s not always going to be
  easy finding time to go to the bowling alley, but resolutions take
  work, and we&#8217;re here for it.  Tomorrow, we&#8217;re going to go to church
  and continue lounging around the house.  There&#8217;s also some football on
  tomorrow.  With the Bears eliminated, I&#8217;ve decided to hitch my casual
  attention to the New Orleans Saints for the duration of the playoffs.
  Tomorrow, they play the Vikings, and if they win (I&#8217;m pretty sure they
  will), they go on to play the Packers.  Did you know they also have
  <a href="https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/1183329028326993921?s=20">the Pope&#8217;s blessing</a>?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  Hope you have a great Saturday.  Let&#8217;s do
  this!</p>
