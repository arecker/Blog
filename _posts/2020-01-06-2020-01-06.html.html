<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing well today.  I&#8217;d like to
  share a small victory with you this morning.  After finally completing
  the &#8220;Numbers&#8221; section in Dutch Duolingo, I moved onto &#8220;Conjunctions
  1&#8221;, and for the past few days I have been wrestling with a new grammar
  rule that affects word order.  For the most part, I think Duolingo
  does a really good job preventing you from overthinking things.  You
  learn purely from examples, and when you need to read about why you
  got something wrong, you can click a button that takes you to an open
  comment forum tied to the question.  Usually, somebody takes the time
  to outline a rule that&#8217;s confusing everyone.  This new rule has really
  been a thorn in my side, and I was starting to get discouraged.  Last
  night, I sat at the dining room table in front of my cold leftovers
  mauling it over while Rodney played with his Nerf gun in the living
  room and Marissa continued painting the windows.  After wading through
  comments and google results, it finally clicked.</p>
<p>The rule had to do with <i>subordinate clauses</i>, or the way I like to
  think of them, combinations of words that could make a sentence if it
  didn&#8217;t start with a word like &#8220;because&#8221; or &#8220;if&#8221;.  For example take the
  sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don&#8217;t know if he eats vegetables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>subordinate clause</i> would be <i>if he heats vegatables</i>.  It has a
  subject, a verb, and it&#8217;s even a complete thought.  But because of the
  <i>if</i>, it cannot stand alone as a sentence.  If you walked up to
  somebody and whispered into their ear <i>If he eats vegetables</i>, you
  might confuse or frustrate someone with the incomplete thought.</p>
<p>In Dutch, the verb within a subordinate clause moves to the end of
  the clause.  So literally translated, the above would read</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don&#8217;t know if he vegetables eats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you see why I was feeling hopeless?  That&#8217;s a very nuanced rule to
  pull out of comments.  And to add to it, this was the first section
  where the comments seemed a little different.  Normally they&#8217;re
  flooded with poorly written questions revolving something covered in
  the first few sections, but I can tell that I&#8217;ve gotten to a point
  where fewer people have made it.  The comments are more articulate,
  and even a little angry.</p>
<p>Last night, as I was cleaning the kitchen, I started to space out and
  stare at a plaque on my wall.  It&#8217;s a silly little saying written in
  Dutch delft that translates</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Beer, beer, I will drink you, even if I have to crawl on all fours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was staring at the sentence, something jumped out at me.  The
  <i>even if I have to crawl on all fours</i> - that was a subordinate
  clause!  As dictated by the new rule I learned that evening, the verb
  came at the very end.  So it literally translated to</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230;even If I have to on all fours crawl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in Dutch, <i>al moel ik op handen foeten kruipen</i>.  Isn&#8217;t that
  ironic?  I had been wrestling with this grammar rule, and suddenly
  after getting it down, I realize that a perfect example sentence has
  been hanging on my wall.</p>
<p>So Dutch is going great.  And to change speeds a bit, we had a great
  weekend.  My wife kicked butt on the living room and managed to get
  all the windows in our living room painted this weekend.  Last night
  before going to bed, we gathered around the project whiteboard and
  triumphantly tossed the completed cards into the garbage.  It felt
  good to get all of our thoughts and ideas down onto cards, but it
  feels even better watching the deck of cards shrink.  Last night, the
  empowering reality that we can get real work done in only a week
  started to settle in.  &#8220;This is a good system,&#8221; Marissa said before we
  turned in for the night.  &#8220;I feel encouraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>So between Dutch grammar and house projects, victories abound.  Well,
  they abound for everyone but the New Orleans Saints.  They were
  swiftly eliminated from playoff contention by the Vikings yesterday,
  who inexplicably played like a real contending team.  There&#8217;s this
  joke about how the Vikings play great against everyone except the
  Bears, and watching the game, I couldn&#8217;t help but dwell on that
  superstition.  The Saints kept it interesting and forced an overtime,
  but it only took one drive and an easy lob to end it all.  &#8220;Now who am
  I going to root for in the playoffs,&#8221; I griped.  &#8220;Maybe I should cheer
  for Greenbay so they also get eliminated.&#8221;</p>
<p>For dinner, I made chicken breast, mashed sweet potatoes, and a
  mushroom sausage wine pan sauce.  It turned out great, but I didn&#8217;t
  make enough sweet potatoes, which was unexpected.  I boil russet
  potatoes for our family all the time, and four russets seemingly last
  us a week.  I suppose sweet potatoes do the opposite.  Maybe they get
  smaller when they cook.  Maybe they&#8217;re filled with water - who knows!</p>
<p>All in all, we had a great, restful weekend.  This work week is going
  to get a little dicey.  We are starting the hiring rounds for our
  summer internship program, and I have a lot of code screens coming my
  way.  This week, Marissa and I area also attacking a corner of our
  basement.  I have a feeling it&#8217;s going to be an exhausting week, but I
  also know that we&#8217;re probably going to close things off at the bowling
  alley.  The bowling alley is a magical place.  There&#8217;s nothing to do -
  no expectations or obligations.  No deadlines bearing down.  Just a
  relaxing little corner of our universe that comforts me, knowing it&#8217;s
  waiting for us at the end of this busy week.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful week.  Stick to your commitments and
  resolutions, and take time to celebrate when you complete them.  Have
  a great Monday, everyone!</p>
