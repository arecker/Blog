<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  How is everybody doing today on this
  wonderful winter morning?  I checked the forecast this morning before
  heading downstairs, as I usually do, and &#8220;light snow&#8221; caught my
  attention.  Remember to bundle up today, it looks like today might
  actually feel like a mid January winter day.  Realistically, we seem
  to get most of our snow in the early spring don&#8217;t we?  This past
  December, we barely had any snow, so now these days I just expect to
  get buried in January, February, and maybe even March.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to lie to you, reader.  I&#8217;m having a hard time waking up
  this morning - as if talking about the weather and snow is going to
  help.  Something about this early January has been really tiring me
  out.  I&#8217;m actually tempted to blame the same cold that we all caught
  during our holiday travels.  My nose was pretty stuffed up this
  morning, and I have to wonder if the effects are still lingering.  But
  colds be damned - the only remedy for unexplained tiredness is just to
  keep marching on and hope something changes.</p>
<p>Yesterday, to my advantage, was not as busy as I thought it would be.
  My only code screen of the day was a no-show.  Someone not showing up
  to an interview doesn&#8217;t always necessitate a tragic misunderstanding.
  I bet some of these college kids must apply to a whole slew of
  internships, and when they accept one, they might not have time to
  cancel all the other outstanding offers and interviewers.  And believe
  me, I absolutely don&#8217;t mind a no-show either.  As I told our
  recruiter, all it means for me is I get thirty free minutes to work on
  something alone in a private room, or better yet just sit back in my
  chair and not think about anything.  I&#8217;m reminded of the classic John
  Mulaney bit - &#8220;cancelling plans is like heroine - it&#8217;s instant
  relief.&#8221;</p>
<p>So yesterday worked out just fine, and it wasn&#8217;t as busy of a work day
  as I anticipated.  Today should be kind to me too.  I have some
  meetings in the morning, and assuming I can find something juicy to
  work on, I should have plenty of quiet coding time for the rest of the
  day.</p>
<p>After work, I took Rodney to Hy-Vee, as we usually do.  We picked up
  pasta, garlic, and a half pound of scallops from the meat counter.  I
  left the card pressed up against the lobster tank to Rodney to peak
  his head in.  &#8220;Lobsters are sleeping,&#8221; Rodney reported back with
  disappointment in his voice.  Ever since he happened to witness a
  passionate lobster fight at the Jenny Street market, just seeing
  lobsters chilling in a tank of water doesn&#8217;t do it for him anymore.</p>
<p>Heading up to the checkout, we stopped by the big basket of chocolate
  Kinder eggs, as we normally do.  While digging around for an egg,
  Rodney found a misplaced peppermint white chocolate bar.  He held it
  in front of me, signaling that he made his choice.  &#8220;Are you sure
  dude,&#8221; I questioned.  &#8220;This is peppermint, it might not taste like
  what you&#8217;d expect.&#8221;  Rodney held it closer to my face, persisting.  We
  unwrapped it in the car, and taking the first bite, he declared &#8220;SO
  TASTY.&#8221;  So I guess it worked out.</p>
<p>At home, Rodney played with his toys in the living room while I
  prepared dinner.  The plan was to make garlic pasta, then somewhere in
  the mix, find time and stovetop space to fry some scallops in brown
  butter.  As I opened the bag of scallops over the sink, a very funky
  puff of old fish filled my nostrils and made me wince.  I rolled me
  eyes.  Sometimes, I don&#8217;t even know why I bother with Hy-Vee&#8217;s
  scallops.  For most items - beef, chicken, pork, even white fish -
  they do a pretty good job of making sure everything is fresh and
  edible.  But I knew I shouldn&#8217;t have rolled the dice on the bucket of
  tiny limp scallops sitting in murky water.  I know a savvy fish
  shopper would have asked to smell them before buying, but I go to
  Hy-Vee every day, and I don&#8217;t want to be marked as <i>that guy who asks
  to smell the fish</i>.  &#8220;Whatever,&#8221; I thought.  &#8220;They might not be fresh,
  but I trust Hy-Vee just enough to not make us sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meal turned out just fine.  Brown butter, lemon zest, and garlic
  cover a multitude of old seafood sins.  I even toasted some slices of
  leftover french bread in the butter and smeared it with tomato pesto.
  As we ate, Marissa told me about all the projects she got done around
  the house.  &#8220;I saw what you did to our bedroom,&#8221; I remarked.  &#8220;It&#8217;s so
  cozy now, I almost feel lucky I get to sleep there.&#8221;  Marissa nodded.
  Earlier that day, we reflected on the state of things.  We&#8217;ve put a
  lot of work into this house, but sometimes our bedroom goes unnoticed.
  For the longest time, we didn&#8217;t even have a bed - it was just a
  mattress on the corner.</p>
<p>I led Rodney upstairs to bed.  We had a small confrontation that led
  me to raise my voice.  &#8220;Dada go drink water you&#8217;ll feel better,&#8221; he
  said drying up his tears.  &#8220;You want a glass of water?&#8221; I asked.
  &#8220;No,&#8221; he insisted.  &#8220;Dada drink water and feel better.&#8221;  He led me by
  the hand over to the sink, and poured me a half glass of water from
  the sink, handing it to me.  &#8220;See?  All better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though sweet, that moment was kind of puzzling to me.  Later Marissa
  clarified.  &#8220;He woke up crying one night, and I told him drinking a
  glass of water would make him feel better,&#8221; she explained.  It&#8217;s sweet
  that he took it as life advice.  And he&#8217;s not wrong, is he?  Getting a
  glass of water always makes you feel better.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  Hope you have a wonderful Tuesday.  Rodney
  reminds you that if you&#8217;re upset about something today, take time to
  get a glass of water.  It will make you feel better.</p>
