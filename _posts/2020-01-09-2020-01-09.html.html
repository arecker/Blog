<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  How are you all feeling today?  This morning
  I feel like I was hit by a very tiny train.  Last night Marissa and I
  attacked a corner of the basement.  In merely an hour, we broke down
  about twenty cardboard boxes, filled our trunk with things ready for
  Goodwill, and set aside three black garbage bags for the recycling
  center.  I put a tiny speaker up by the window sill, and we worked
  feverishly.  &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling pretty motivated now,&#8221; said Marissa as we
  were wrapping up.  When we were all done, we retreated upstairs to
  create more work cards, then we crashed on the couch.  Sitting there
  in our living room, I was grateful to be finally relaxing on the
  couch, and that beer tasted like something sent from Heaven.  Work
  feels good, doesn&#8217;t it?  This morning, even though I&#8217;m sore and still
  a bit exhausted, I&#8217;m still enjoying the afterglow.  This morning, I
  just went downstairs to walk around and admire our work.  I&#8217;m feeling
  proud, and I too am feeling motivated.</p>
<p>Cleaning the basement was a vigorous ending to a great day.  I worked
  from home pretty much all day, and Marissa hung around the house too.
  In the afternoon, we swung by my work building so I could pick up a
  charger from IT, then we went out for pizza.  As we ate, we couldn&#8217;t
  help but overhear the table beside us - two guys who had already
  finished their lunch, one of them dressed in all khaki like some kind
  of forest ranger, and the other in regular street clothes.  They were
  very loudly talking about the specifics of their new start-up which
  was to farm and sell honey.  &#8220;So&#8230; what if somebody comes along and
  SUES us,&#8221; they continued, as Marissa and I smirking at each other.  We
  left Ian&#8217;s, still chatting about the encounter.  &#8220;Well they were
  probably at Ian&#8217;s Pizza for two and a half hours, this new company
  must already be going great,&#8221; I cracked.  &#8220;Yeah, and remember, they
  were already done when we got there, and we left together,&#8221; Marissa
  added.</p>
<p>I worked through the rest of the afternoon, then spent a few minutes
  at the family computer looking for a new dinner recipe.  &#8220;What are you
  in the mood for?&#8221; I hollered to Marissa in the living room.
  &#8220;Something salad-y,&#8221; she said.  I rolled my eyes.  &#8220;What about
  something soupy?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about you do soup and salad?&#8221; she suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do soup <i>and</i> salad,&#8221; I sneered.  &#8220;It&#8217;s soup <i>or</i> salad.&#8221;
  Marissa, who had joined Rodney at his train table dismissed the
  technicality.  As we were arguing, I stumbled upon a recipe for
  goulash that sounded pretty good.  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to make goulash,&#8221; I
  yelled.  &#8220;And I&#8217;ll pick up a salad kit on the side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney, enraptured with a good playtime session, didn&#8217;t want to go to
  Hy-Vee that evening.  I was on the same page - Wednesdays feel
  different since I hang around the house, so I wasn&#8217;t offended.  Plus,
  my goulash would need plenty of time on the stove.  I speedily left
  for Hy-Vee, buying macaroni noodles, onion, ground beef, and canned
  tomatoes.  Back at home, I happily assembled the goulash while putting
  away the groceries and cleaning the kitchen.  As the recipe neared
  completion, I started to feel like a grade-school lunch lady,
  occasionally stirring the big pot of brown liquid.</p>
<p>Over dinner as we ate goulash, Marissa recapped her afternoon.  She
  had spent some time at a Dentist office on the west side of town
  setting up her art.  The deal was they would display her art for a few
  months, and in turn they wouldn&#8217;t collect any commission on the sales.
  At the dinner table, we kicked around the pros and cons of the
  arrangement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose if these were really bad dudes, they could suddenly up and
  leave town with all your art,&#8221; I said chewing a mouthful of noodles.
  &#8220;What if it wasn&#8217;t even a real dentist office?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa chuckled.  &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t know about that.  I saw a lot of
  dentists and patients walking around,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actors,&#8221; I interjected, wagging my finger.  &#8220;They might all be
  actors.  Here&#8217;s what these people do.  It&#8217;s a fake dentist office.
  All the equipment is stolen, and that location you visited - they&#8217;re
  probably just squatting.  They find an artist on Instagram, get them
  to agree to loan art, then suddenly they&#8217;ll disappear.  You&#8217;ll go back
  and it will just be an empty building.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, that sounds like a lot of work,&#8221; Marissa said laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh sure,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of work, but after you wait a year for
  things to cool down and slowly sell the paintings&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere other than Instagram, because I would see it,&#8221; Marissa
  added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, somewhere other than Instagram.&#8221;  I continued.  &#8220;Then pay off
  all the extras that played fake dentists and patients, I bet you could
  make it out with a cool twelve hundred dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is not a lot of money,&#8221; Marissa said shaking her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure - but that&#8217;s just one artist.  You&#8217;d be doing this to maybe
  twelve artists at a time, and as long as they don&#8217;t know each other,
  it will work.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that was yesterday.  Today, I&#8217;m grateful it&#8217;s already Thursday.  I
  have a code screen in the morning, then I have some more coding to do
  in the afternoon.  I&#8217;m pretty tired, but kicking it with my family
  this weekend and hanging out at the bowling alley sounds so like a
  fitting reward.  At this point, I&#8217;m probably as excited to go bowling
  this weekend as Rodney is.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful day.  Whether you make your money
  farming honey from bees, or working as a fake dentist for Instagram
  art con men, I&#8217;m sure you deserve a restful weekend as well.  Hang in
  there - we&#8217;re almost there.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful Thursday, everyone.  Here&#8217;s to the near weekend!</p>
