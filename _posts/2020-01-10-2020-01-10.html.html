<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  How is everyone feeling today?  This morning,
  I&#8217;m feeling well rested.  This time of year, hot showers seem to keep
  me sane, but it&#8217;s hard to step out of a really good shower on a cold
  morning, isn&#8217;t it?  Most mornings I picture myself like Kramer in the
  Seinfeld episode where he decides to live in the shower.  I&#8217;m sure if
  my work computer were waterproof, I would try it for just a day.</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t you glad it&#8217;s Friday?  I am.  I&#8217;m relieved it&#8217;s Friday.
  Between working in the basement and working at home, I feel exhausted,
  but equally happy and grateful we&#8217;re just about done.  Just as I
  described to Rodney last night while putting him to bed, we have
  plenty to look forward to.  We&#8217;re going to get some snow tonight,
  we&#8217;re going to make a pizza, and on Saturday, we&#8217;re going bowling.
  The Recker family gets hyped about Saturdays at the bowling alley.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also feeling tired from working in the basement this week, but
  still reeling from what we accomplished.  Marissa and I share the same
  disbelief.  &#8220;Today I went downstairs to do a load of wash,&#8221; she
  explained, &#8220;and I noticed I was still stepping over and weaving
  between the imaginary garbage that&#8217;s no longer there.&#8221;  I laughed,
  picturing her zig zagging through an open corner of the basement out
  of habit.</p>
<p>Thursday was a long, hard day for the both of us.  Marissa had a tough
  agility class.  Ziggy was at a high energy level, and they were having
  a tough time connecting while training, and Rodney didn&#8217;t help the
  situation either.  &#8220;Rodney is feeling more confident there,&#8221; she said.
  &#8220;He&#8217;s friendly to everyone, and likes to get involved, but now he&#8217;s
  less likely to just sit and entertain himself.&#8221;  I continued listening
  as we sat around the dinner table at Pasquale&#8217;s.  Rodney had claimed
  our second bowl of taco chips for himself.  He even got angry with me
  when I tried to take a chip, leading to an intense dinner table stare
  down.</p>
<p>Marissa and I continued to vent and exchange stories.  I didn&#8217;t have a
  great day at work either.  I didn&#8217;t get as much work done as I had
  hoped.  All this week, I have been trying to jump into a new project,
  using a new programming language and new framework, and I was starting
  to feel restless.  I seemingly can&#8217;t find enough time to focus and
  gain some traction, and by yesterday it was starting to frustrate me.
  Sometimes, I wish I could freeze time, and sit with something for six
  or seven hours in absolute silence until I understand it.  And as soon
  as I start to build some momentum, I get a slack message or a calendar
  notification.  My concentration breaks, and it feels like I have to
  start over again.</p>
<p>The best part of my work day yesterday had to be my leftover goulash.
  I filled a bowl and left it in the work microwave while I selected a
  drink from the fridge.  I relished the smell as it started to trickle
  out of the break room.  I ate in the break room with Heath, Nate, and
  Karl.  Karl, who just had a baby, recently returned from paternity
  leave and was regaling us with stories from the big lifestyle change.
  Nate was picking at a flimsy chicken breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nate, I just have to say, that chicken breast looks like you bought
  it on an airplane,&#8221; Heath teased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Nate replied.  &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t.  This one is all on me.  The
  worst part is that the seasoning is fake.  It looks like it should
  taste like something, but I think it&#8217;s just supposed to look
  seasoned.&#8221;  I laughed, reflecting on the concept of <i>fake seasoning</i>.
  &#8220;What are you eating today, Recker?&#8221; said Heath turning to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goulash,&#8221; I replied, playing with my fork.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a one pot meal, and
  I kind of got to give my family the middle school lunch lady
  experience - you know, <i>ENJOY YA NUTRITIOUS MEAL KID.  NO SECONDS.</i>,&#8221;
  I said with my best hoarse smoker&#8217;s voice, miming slapping a pile of
  food onto a plate.</p>
<p>I worked through the afternoon, the joined my coworkers on the seventh
  floor for happy hour.  Having only ten minutes before my bus arrived
  outside, I decided not to imbibe.  Last time, I had to practically
  chug the rest of my White Claw, and it left me feeling sort of woozy
  after heading home.  I stayed just long enough to chat about the day
  and bid everyone farewell.</p>
<p>After going out to dinner with Marissa, I put Rodney to bed.  We read
  a book about how Spider-Man, Ironman, the Hulk, and Thor challenged
  ice monsters from another dimension to a snowball fight.  &#8220;Look dude -
  that&#8217;s Spider-man, Ironman, and that&#8217;s the Hulk.&#8221;  Rodney looked up
  from our book, puzzled.  &#8220;No, not hulk.  That&#8217;s hulk,&#8221; he said
  pointing at one of the ice monsters.  &#8220;Agree to disagree,&#8221; I said,
  smiling back at him.</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, I went into chill mode.  I changed into
  some sweats and hung out on the couch with my laptop, letting YouTube
  run in the background.  I spent the evening tidying up some of my side
  projects and cleaning up the automation around my blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also starting to branch out into the world of mainstream NFL.  I
  watched a video on the top rookies of 2019 and some general reactions
  to major off season decisions.  I&#8217;m finally bearing witness to how
  underrepresented the Chicago Bears are in most discussions.  Mitch
  Trubisky was mentioned once - and used as an example of a promising
  young quarterback who turned a disappointing corner.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  I allowed myself plenty of extra time to
  publish my entry today, just in case I broke the script last night
  while shuffling things around.  There&#8217;s nothing worse than seeing an
  error message and code puke out onto your screen as you&#8217;re trying to
  rush out the door to catch a bus.</p>
<p>Hey - thanks for reading, and happy Friday.  You&#8217;re practically done
  for the week.  There&#8217;s nothing left to do but to cook meals, shovel
  snow, and take your family bowling.  Have a great Friday, everyone.</p>
