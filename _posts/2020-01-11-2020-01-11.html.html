<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re all feeling good this Saturday
  morning.  Today, we all slept in, and we just wrapped up breakfast.
  I&#8217;m feeling well-rested, fed, and grateful.  While waiting for the
  Dutch baby to finish in the oven, I cleaned the kitchen with Rodney&#8217;s
  help, and made a short TODO list for the day.</p>
<p>Here - this will be fun - why don&#8217;t I just share my TODO list?</p>

<p>I was grateful to sleep in today.  Yesterday was a long day.  I had a
  regular workday, went out to lunch with my teammates, then stepped out
  for the afternoon to go to a doctor&#8217;s appointment.  At the last scan,
  the doctor heard an arythmia in baby Miles&#8217; heart beat - and we heard
  it too.  It was almost as if his heart would skip a beat every four
  counts, like a flam on a snare drum.  The analogy stuck and since
  then, we&#8217;ve been referring to it as his <i>jazz heart</i>.  Yesterday was
  the follow up appointment.  We were nervous, but the doctor
  immediately attenuated our fear by reporting that the arythmia went
  away and the heart beat sounded normal again.  &#8220;These things come and
  go,&#8221; the doctor explained.  &#8220;The heart muscles are immature at this
  stage, and they do weird things.  The important thing is that the
  structure of the heart still looks good.&#8221;  What a relief!  We
  celebrated by grabbing a quick cup off coffee and snack at Collectivo,
  then I returned to work to wrap up the day.</p>
<p>After bussing home, the three of us drove to Hy-Vee to pick up
  groceries.  With a snowstorm approaching, soup started to sound like a
  better idea than pizza.  We went with leek and potato, which has
  become a stand by favorite in our house.  Returning home, Marissa
  painted while Rodney and I hung around the kitchen and cooked.</p>
<p>After finishing dinner, my back started to feel sore, and I had a
  headache coming on.  The day wasn&#8217;t particularly tough, and we were
  most excited to get good news from the doctor, but it was as if the
  entire work week caught up with my head and body all at once.  Marissa
  graciously excused me to go take a nap upstairs, agreeing to put
  Rodney to bed.</p>
<p>I slept like the dead until 10:30, and when I emerged from our
  bedroom, I felt like I was walking around on a different planet.  I
  crashed on the couch to allow my body to readjust.  Marissa was
  wrapping up a painting upstairs and joined me on the couch.  I got up,
  and not exactly knowing what to do with myself, I picked up Rodney&#8217;s
  football and threw it to Marissa.  She flinched, but caught the ball
  in her arm, then threw it back to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;You throw a really nice spiral - I think it&#8217;s better than mine,&#8221; I
  complimented her, throwing the ball back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to play catch with my dad,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait until Rodney is old enough to carry on a game of catch.
  I really miss throwing the ball around with somebody,&#8221; I explained.
  Marissa nodded, replying &#8220;I feel the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa and I continued talking, throwing the football back and forth.
  The dogs, at first riled up from the moving ball, eventually
  acclimated and we continued talking.  It was almost as if playing
  catch activated old memories - we traded stories of prom, awkward
  first dates, childhood memories, bullies, and fights.  Marissa and I
  lost track of time, and played catch in the living room until 12:30.</p>
<p>&#8220;OK, it&#8217;s time to have a snack,&#8221; said Marissa, excusing herself into
  the kitchen.  I popped some popcorn, and we reconvened on the couch to
  watch a movie.  Feeling refreshed from a long nap, I had no problem
  staying up a little later to watch an hour of a movie.  I picked the
  movie <i>Catfish</i>, which is an interesting documentary about
  impersonating people on the Internet.  We finally called it a night at
  1:30.  I did my best to clean the kitchen and start a load in the
  dishwasher, then we called it a day.</p>
<p>After writing, I&#8217;ll probably take Rodney outside.  I promised him that
  we would play in the snow while I shoveled.  As expected, the promised
  <i>snowpocalypse</i> only yielded about two inches of snow, and it looks
  like my neighbor decided to do our side of the driveway as well.  We
  live next to some good people - you gotta love that.</p>
<p>So instead of shoveling, it looks like I&#8217;m just going to take Rodney
  outside to play in the snow for a bit.  If it feels nice out, we might
  go for a walk.  Unfortunately, Rodney&#8217;s sled didn&#8217;t make it through
  the summer.  This past fall, a big crack formed in the middle and we
  had to discard it, but we might be able to fashion a makeshift sled
  out of a big tupperware bin and some rope, and that might be just good
  enough to drag around the block.  We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re also looking to empty the project board of all remaining
  tasks.  There are only a few cards left, and even though we&#8217;re still
  trying to figure out a natural home project workload for a typical
  week, the temptation to go above and beyond is there.  Later today, if
  we have time before bowling, I might set up some new tech toys we got
  in the mail.  I spent my cut of our Christmas money on a new wireless
  access point, and I think this might be the upgrade that makes our
  WiFi reachable from the bar across the street.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Today, we&#8217;re just hanging around the
  house, working on what we feel like, playing in the snow, and later
  today we&#8217;ll end the day by going bowling.  We might also watch some
  football this afternoon - both the Packers and the Vikings have
  play-off games, so I&#8217;m going to do my best to keep tabs on them.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great day everyone.  Go play in the snow or something.</p>
