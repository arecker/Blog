<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  From the bottom of my heart, I&#8217;d like to wish
  you a happy Friday.  I like to make a big deal out of Friday.  Even
  though it occurs every week, I think making it through another week is
  always something worth celebrating.</p>
<p>Another week in January, no less.  Isn&#8217;t January brutal?  There&#8217;s
  nothing to look forward to in January.  The weather punishes you for
  going outside with biting wind and treacherous ice on your stairs.
  Your car takes longer to warm up, and ice and salt collects around
  your wheels.  In season fruits like tomatoes and watermelon are a
  distant memory, and you really have nothing to look forward to - and
  yet you have to carry forward all the commitments you made on January
  first.  Maybe you&#8217;ve committed to eating healthy.  Maybe you&#8217;ve
  committed to drinking less alcohol.  Maybe you committed to picking up
  a new skill or hobby, and in this time of January it seems you have to
  stare it in the face and have to ask, &#8220;Is this really something I can
  do.&#8221;  Anyone can commit to anything during the Holidays.  January
  sucks because you actually have to follow through with these things.
  So I celebrate Fridays.  We made it through another work week.  Our
  society is still functioning, and we can all relax this weekend before
  trying again on Monday.</p>
<p>At work, I finally wrapped up the document I was working on.  I don&#8217;t
  know if I mentioned this yet, but I was preparing a <i>runbook</i> for a
  test we&#8217;ll be executing today.  A &#8220;runbook&#8221; is kind of an industry
  term for an instruction sheet intended for someone who is already
  familiar with the overall process, so it&#8217;s going to be skimpy on the
  context and explanations, but curt and copy-paste friendly.  Later
  this afternoon (on a Friday night of all times), one of my teammates
  will sign on line to intentionally take down our service in our
  isolated staging environment.  He&#8217;ll run the commands right out of my
  runbook while communicating to a number of other teams throughout our
  company so they have a chance to see how their service tolerates the
  outage.  And if I did my job right, he can do so while barely paying
  attention.  It&#8217;s a Friday night, after all, I think he deserves that
  much.</p>
<p>But needless to say, I was proud of the completeness of the document.
  My role at my company has changed over time, and I&#8217;ve had to walk
  through a lot of shoddily documented procedures for services which I
  wasn&#8217;t even aware of.  I&#8217;m more specialized these days, but my long
  tenure as a general <i>operations</i> person allowed me to develop good
  taste when it comes to writing instructions.  Keep things simple.
  don&#8217;t explain <i>why</i> - stick to <i>how</i>.  Make it easy to copy-paste -
  but also make it easy to pull apart and figure out where something
  went wrong.</p>
<p>Spending the morning typing, my back was starting to feel a little
  sore, so I went for a walk.  It was far too cold to walk outside, so
  instead I went for a stroll around the office.  I walked up and down
  the stairwell, walked along the outside windows, and stopped to stare
  at the capitol building.</p>
<p>I worked through the afternoon, then joined some of my coworkers on
  the eighth floor for happy hour.  I finished a half pale ale while we
  chatted, then left to catch my bus.  Back at home, Marissa took me up
  on my offer to go to Hy-Vee together as a family.  &#8220;I just cleaned our
  fridge last night, and we could use some new snacks,&#8221; I said, knowing
  that there was little chance a second trimester pregnant lady would
  turn down that offer.  &#8220;Can you drive?  I want to eat a muffin in the
  car,&#8221; she negotiated.</p>
<p>We strolled around Hy-Vee, picking up potatoes, kale, bacon, and
  mushrooms.  I usually make stamppot with sausage, but following
  Marissa&#8217;s wishes, I decided to try it with mushrooms instead.  Back at
  home, after unloading the car, I got to work peeling potatoes, slicing
  bacon, and washing kale leaves.  Rodney helped in the kitchen too,
  scooting our sturdy kitchen ladder over to the stove where I had some
  butter melting for a roux.  &#8220;Now you need to keep the roux moving,&#8221; I
  warned him, wrapping his small hand around the whisk.  &#8220;Keep it going
  until it&#8217;s the color of coffee.&#8221;  I knew there was zero chance he was
  following along, but I think he took to the sense of urgency.  He
  wildly flung the whisk around the pan while I supervised.</p>
<p>We killed the heat on the roux and shifted focus to drain the
  potatoes.  I handed Rodney the potato masher, and he looked visibly
  relieved to work with things he understood.  &#8220;Just smash the potatoes,
  dude. There&#8217;s no wrong way to do this,&#8221; I said.  Rodney wildly slammed
  the masher against the bottom of the Dutch oven, sending some chunks
  of moist potato flying across the stove.  &#8220;That&#8217;s no big deal dude,
  just mash &#8216;em,&#8221; I goaded.</p>
<p>We sat around the table and ate dinner.  It had been a long week for
  me and Marissa.  We quietly wolfed down our dinner.  Rodney was the
  only one at the table keeping a steady conversation going, delving
  into his favorite topic of taking his cousins to a water park.</p>
<p>After dinner, I gave Rodney a bath, changed him into his pajamas, and
  read him a story.  Just before bed, he asked for a glass of water.
  Fearing we were about to begin another long round of bedtime
  filibustering, I urged him to stay in his room.  &#8220;Just stay here -
  I&#8217;ll get you a cup of water and you can drink it in bed,&#8221; I said
  leaving his room.  Rodney hesitantly reached for the glass and swiftly
  tipped it at his mouth, but being in bed, he miscalculated the angle
  of his head and sent water all over his head.  Tears were had, but
  after a quick pajama swap and some bed sheet re arrangement, we were
  back in business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he accidentally waterboard himself again?&#8221; Marissa asked as I
  trudged down the stairs into our living room and slinked onto the
  couch.  &#8220;Yeah&#8230; poor guy,&#8221; I replied.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the evening on the couch.  As I lie under the
  blanket, it was almost as if the tired muscles in my back were singing
  praises, knowing their job was done for the day.  Ziggy climbed into
  my lab, and I coaxed her under the blanket with me for a long nap.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.</p>
