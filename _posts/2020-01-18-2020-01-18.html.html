<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Saturday.  I hope you took your time
  today, made a good breakfast, and have a mix of fun and productive
  things planned.  I spent this morning cleaning up the kitchen,
  listening to a podcast, and cooking breakfast.</p>
<p>Low priority, trivial incidents swallowed yesterday&#8217;s work day.  My
  team helped out with a production incident in the morning, and there
  was another in the afternoon before we went home for the day, and
  between the two, Nate and I joined the other two Madison foundation
  teams for lunch at the Old Fashioned.  We shared a pitcher of <i>Spruce
  Juice</i> - a delicious, unique IPA that tastes like pine needles that we
  save for Fridays.</p>
<p>As the weather took a downward turn, the office started to thin out,
  and I took the bus home a little earlier than normal.  Getting home, I
  left Rodney to sleep, made a quick batch of pizza dough, and decided
  to brave the adverse weather alone to pick up the rest of the
  ingredients from Hy-Vee.  Truthfully, the roads weren&#8217;t that bad.
  Less than an inch of wet snow coated the roads, but evidently that was
  enough snow to scare everyone into operating there car as if it was a
  Zamboni.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong - I think you should drive carefully.
  But if it takes you the entire green light to accelerate through an
  intersection, you&#8217;re probably doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>After returning home with the groceries, I unpacked everything and
  started making pizza.  It was a good night to eat pizza, but
  truthfully, I just wanted another low-stakes trial run of my deep dish
  recipe.  I&#8217;ve talked it up to my family, and my sister&#8217;s family is
  staying with us next week.  I wanted to experiment with adding more
  cheese to the pizza.  The pizza tasted just fine, but structurally it
  was a bit of a mess.  That third layer of cheese was too much for the
  pizza to handle, and much like Icarus who flew too close to the sun,
  the results were a melty mess.</p>
<p>After dinner, I practiced Dutch.  Having only four more sections to do
  before completing the second &#8220;castle&#8221; of duolingo, I doubled down with
  an extra long session, wrapping up <i>location</i> and passing the chapter
  final exam.  This evening, I&#8217;ll be 190 days in, and needless to say
  I&#8217;m feeling proud.  Learning a new language has challenged me, and on
  any given day I might feel unstoppable reflecting on how much progress
  I&#8217;ve made, or also I might feel hopeless looking ahead at how much
  there is to learn.  But through it all, the most important thing I&#8217;ve
  learned is enjoy where I&#8217;m at.</p>
<p>Marissa put Rodney to bed, and afterwards, we retreated to the living
  room to play some Nazi Zombies.  I put on my robe, brewed a cup of
  tea, and built what I&#8217;d have to describe as a throne of supportive
  pillows.  &#8220;You&#8217;re like high maintenance sore back guy,&#8221; Marissa
  teased.  I decided to lean into my new persona for the evening.  Every
  twenty minutes, I would pause the video game mid-carnage and announce
  <i>I REQUIRE A SIP OF TEA</i>, then looking as posh as possible,
  lethargically roll over to grab my mug for a dainty sip.</p>
<p>By the third game, pinned down by the eight wave of zombies with sub
  par weapons, Marissa expressed doubts.  &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t look good,&#8221; she
  said without taking her eyes off the TV.  &#8220;This is too much for just
  sawed off shotguns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s OK,&#8221; I said while strafing backwards waiting for my sluggish gun
  to reload, &#8220;if we die, that just means we can give up and watch the
  rest of Taxi Driver instead.&#8221;  Marissa laughed.</p>
<p>We eventually fell victim to the 9th wave of Zombies, and as promised,
  put on the rest of our movie.  I poured some tequila.  As the credits
  rolled by, Marissa and I discussed the movie.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8230;,&#8221; I started pensively.  &#8220;I think it&#8217;s generally accepted that
  the ending of this movie didn&#8217;t really happen.  I think he actually
  just went on a shooting spree at the political rally, but what we were
  watching at the end is kind of like a fantasy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was getting that sense,&#8221; Marissa added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s what the jazz music was supposed to symbolize - that
  told us we were just watching what was happening in his head.&#8221; I
  continued.</p>
<p>And the unreliable narrator aspect of Taxi Driver is so subtle and
  well done, in contrast to <i>The Joker</i>.  During the fantasy scenes, the
  camera angles are melodramatic, and the dialog is a tad cheesy.  Every
  other character kind of sounds like they&#8217;re being voiced by Travis
  Bickle.  I had suspected <i>Joker</i> was heavily inspired by <i>Taxi
  Driver</i>, but now that we&#8217;ve watched both more recently, I&#8217;m convinced
  the <i>Joker</i> movie was really just a bad rip-off.  <i>Joker</i> tries to
  incorporate the same unreliable narrator angle, the charming but
  creepy protagonist, the obsession and loneliness.  It&#8217;s just done so
  much better in <i>Taxi Driver</i>.  After discussing the movie, we wandered
  around different YouTube videos until we couldn&#8217;t stay awake, then
  went to bed.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;m finishing up a second pot of coffee before I head
  out into the tundra to shovel snow with Rodney.  Hearing him run
  around and throw his ball around the living room, I can imagine that
  he has some extra energy to burn.  Later today, we&#8217;re going bowling
  with Alex and Cassie.  We&#8217;re excited to introduce them to our family&#8217;s
  new favorite way to spend Saturday evenings.</p>
<p>This morning, while looking up the recipe for a Dutch Baby, I also got
  excited about the idea of porting my cooking recipes to an online
  cookbook.  There are some fantastic tools meant to generate static
  websites for technical documentation, and I think that would make for
  a slick looking cookbook and a great Saturday afternoon sized side
  project.  I&#8217;ll find some time to hack on it today and share it here if
  anything comes out of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling content today.  Spending last night on the couch as <i>high</i>
  <i>maintenance sore back guy</i> has paid off.  I&#8217;m feeling loose,
  energetic, and ready to screw around in the fresh snow with my son.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Happy Saturday!</p>
