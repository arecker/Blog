<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re having a great Sunday thus far.
  We&#8217;re having an easy morning, waking up with plenty of time to get to
  the eleven o&#8217;clock church service, but I&#8217;m sure that by the time I&#8217;m
  finished writing this entry, that will no longer be true.  Rodney is
  currently chilling on the couch with a bowl of peanut butter captain
  crunch and a glass of juice.  As per usual, he&#8217;s watching water slide
  videos.  Getting him out of bed this morning, he was still practically
  glowing from our <i>bowling party</i> last night with our friends Alex and
  Cassie.  We kept him up until 9:30 PM, which in toddler time must be
  the same as 3 in the morning, so it&#8217;s no wonder he was still talking
  about it when he woke up.  &#8220;Rodney loves bowling parties,&#8221; he said
  while sleepily rubbing his eyes.</p>
<p>I should have probably started writing this entry sooner, but I got
  distracted by my new side project.  Yesterday morning I started
  tinkering around with creating an online cookbook, so I&#8217;ve been
  on-and-off distracted by it since.  I ported four of my recipes from
  my personal notes so far, and I can&#8217;t stop looking at the final
  result.  I fired off a link to Alex yesterday, and we chatted about it
  at the bowling alley.  I see this as a great opportunity for me to
  clean up my old recipes and standardize them with a clean format.
  It&#8217;s got me pretty excited.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I spent some time hacking on my
  online cookbook, but I also spent a good amount of time shoveling
  snow, and later playing in the snow with Rodney.  Yesterday&#8217;s snow,
  slightly damp from the sun and warmer air, made for perfect snowballs,
  so not wanting to waste the opportunity, I took a break and pelted the
  side of our house with Rodney.  There&#8217;s few things in life that are
  more satisfying than a good snowball exploding on a brick wall, right?</p>
<p>For lunch time, we grazed on leftovers from our fridge, heating up
  stammpot and pizza.  Marissa announced she was &#8220;going to do a brunch
  thing,&#8221; sitting down with a bagel and grapefruit.  &#8220;More like a
  pregnancy craving thing,&#8221; I teased.</p>
<p>After putting Rodney down for a nap, Marissa and I hung out on the
  couch and watched some sketch re runs.  We wouldn&#8217;t be meeting Alex
  and Cassie until six, giving us plenty of time to nap and relax.</p>
<p>Finally, it came time for us to head out.  We jumped in the car and
  drove to our bowling alley, where Alex and Cassie were waiting for us
  hanging out at the bar.  They looked pretty content having drinks and
  watching a boxing match on TV.  &#8220;Bowling alley bars are a great place
  to hide out,&#8221; I later remarked to Alex.  &#8220;They&#8217;re very relaxing in
  their own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>We rented a lane, each of us giving up one shoe as collateral.  As the
  guy went in the back to put our shoes away, we remarked at how strange
  of a system it was.  Who&#8217;s going to steal a pair of old bowling shoes?
  How would having your shoes help the situation?  If I walked out with
  their rental bowling shoes, would they start renting out my shoes to
  offset the theft?</p>
<p>I sat down in front of the dim kiosk to punch in everyone&#8217;s names.  I
  chose silly bowling names for everyone, giving Marissa &#8220;Pregnant
  Lady&#8221;, which the system hilariously abbreviated at <i>P Lady</i>.  We put
  in for an order of pizzas, then perused the racks for our own bowling
  balls.  &#8220;I have this anxiety that whatever bowling ball I pick is
  going to rip off my thumb,&#8221; Marissa shared.  Cassie&#8217;s eyes widened -
  &#8220;Me too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well you know how getting your thumb ripped off is,&#8221; I added.  &#8220;After
  it happens the first time, it&#8217;s not so scary any more.  It&#8217;s part of
  bowling.&#8221;</p>
<p>We played, taking a long break to eat pizza and refill on beer.  I was
  playing pretty terribly, barely keeping up with Rodney&#8217;s score.  I
  felt kind of silly bowling a low 80 on the first game after bragging
  that our new January weekend tradition of bowling has made me stepped
  up my game.  For whatever reason, the mojo wasn&#8217;t there.  I leveraged
  the situation to make Rodney laugh, throwing the ball through my legs
  and trying to put as much spin on the ball as possible.</p>
<p>In the middle of our last game, the lights dimmed and the bowling
  alley switched on their <i>cosmic bowling</i> mode.  We had never stayed at
  the alley past nine, so you could imagine our surprise learning that
  all along we had been missing Saturday cosmic bowling by a mere half
  hour.  The disco lights and loud music gave a tired Rodney second
  wind.  He relished the last few frames, dancing, crawling on his
  belly, and running around with his arms extended like an airplane
  yelling <i>LEEEEET&#8217;S GOOOOOO</i>, in his own <i>Dude Perfect</i> style.  He
  looked purely in his element.</p>
<p>Heading home, Rodney contested going to bed without a story, but soon
  after his head hit the pillow, he was asleep.  Marissa and I were free
  to catch up on cleaning the house, and even empty a few project cards
  from the board.  We wrapped up the night on the couch with a new movie
  pick.  Marissa, continuing her march through the Alien movies, picked
  <i>Aliens</i>.  Before we started the movie, we spent a few minutes on the
  couch throwing out fake titles in a dramatic voice, like <i>Aliens: More
  Aliens</i>, <i>Alien&#8230;s</i>, and <i>Alien: You Though We Were Done?</i>.</p>
<p>Today, after church we&#8217;re going to go out to lunch, then swing by the
  grocery store to pick up food for dinner.  For playoff game day, we&#8217;re
  going to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3GN_W2kVrA">Chef John&#8217;s Buffalo Chicken Wings in a Jar</a>, which sounds
  just perfect for snacking while, in all likelihood, watching a team I
  don&#8217;t care about beat a team I don&#8217;t like in the NFC championship.  Go
  49&#8217;ers (I guess).  In all seriousness, from the little I&#8217;ve seen of
  the 49&#8217;ers this season, they are terrifyingly talented and no doubt
  deserve a super bowl win.  Even better if they eliminate the Packers
  on the way.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a great day today.</p>
