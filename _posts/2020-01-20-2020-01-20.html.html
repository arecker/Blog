excerpt: bbq, naps, projects, and something crazy

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you are having a relaxing day off thus
  far.  With the combination of working hard in the basement last night,
  staying up late, and sleeping in on my day-off, I&#8217;m feeling a little
  groggy this morning.  I spent the last hour or so cleaning up the
  kitchen and putting Rodney&#8217;s clothes away, and that seems to have
  helped wake me up to the point where I can write a coherent journal
  entry.  Sometimes you need an hour or so of menial tasks to help
  metabolize the morning coffee and wake up, you know?</p>
<p>Today I have a day off work for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but I&#8217;m
  also on-call as of 8 AM this morning.  I&#8217;m feeling pretty fortune that
  my on-call rotation landed on this week.  I make a little extra on
  holidays, as they count as weekend hours, and not to mention I have
  one less day to work our support queue, which I only do during
  business hours.</p>
<p>This morning, I toasted some Eggo waffles for Rodney and Marissa, who
  rolled out of bed at almost the exact same time I did.  After
  breakfast, Rodney led Marissa by the hand to the living room, where
  they &#8220;played videogames&#8221;, or more accurately, watched YouTube videos
  of video games with unplugged Xbox controllers in their laps.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day as well.  After church, we decided to
  try out a new BBQ place on the west side of town, and we had a pretty
  good experience.  The food was delicious, and after returning home,
  the smoked brisket, ribs, and nibbles of Rodney&#8217;s pulled pork sent me
  into a full blown food coma.  I changed into something comfy and
  napped on the couch with Ziggy while we watched the Chiefs vs Titans
  game on TV.</p>
<p>After a nap, I got Rodney out of bed and took him to Hy-Vee to pick up
  dinner.  I was planning on an easy night of pork chops with apple
  juice pan sauce, but I also picked up some chicken thighs so I could
  try out a new dip.  Hy-Vee was practically emptied due to the Packers
  playoff game, so Rodney and I could afford to take our time.  Before
  leaving, he selected a chocolate egg from the candy rack.</p>
<p>Back at home, Rodney and Marissa hung out in the dining room watching
  the football game while I prepared dinner.  I was much more pleased
  with the pork chop glaze this time around.  Last week making this
  meal, I didn&#8217;t let the sauce reduce enough, and it looked more like a
  dressing.  I didn&#8217;t make the same mistake last night.  I simmered it
  in my pan until it could all practically fit on a spoon, then whisked
  in some cold chunks of butter.  The final product looked like melted
  caramel, but it tasted like pork and apples.</p>
<p>We let Rodney watch the rest of the football game with me, then
  Marissa put him to bed.  After splitting off to catch up on our
  chores, we reconvened in the kitchen to attack the basement stairs,
  which was the last project card we had planned for the week.</p>
<p>In our project system, every Sunday we drag a new set of cards to the
  TODO column.  The goal is only add to the board what you think you can
  get done in a week, and we use sizes to estimate how much effort each
  card is.  A <i>small</i> is about an hour of work - like last night,
  throwing away all the garbage at the bottom of the stairs.  A <i>medium</i>
  might be a few hours of work, and a <i>large</i> usually spans over a day.
  At the end of the week on Sunday night, we tally up the cards we
  completed - smalls get 1 point, mediums 2 points, and larges 3 points.</p>
<p>Last night, after finishing the basement, Marissa and I met at the
  board in our bedroom and tallied up the cards.  We finished 13 points
  this past week, and the week before was 11.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget, this is
  water slide weekend, so we might not have as much time as last week,&#8221;
  Marissa reminded me.  We adjusted the total planned work for the week,
  leaving room for the fun weekend.  That&#8217;s a great example of what
  advantage we get from tracking projects with points.</p>
<p>Before heading to the couch for the rest of the night, I stopped by
  the kitchen to finish making my dip.  Before heading down into the
  basement, I seared some chicken thighs and gently simmered them in
  some buffalo sauce before allowing them to cool.  I would split apart
  the meat with my fingers, then reduce down the buffalo sauce to a
  syrup and add that as well before chilling the shredded meat in the
  fridge overnight.  I had agreed to only use our choice mild barbecue
  sauce, but after tasting the final product, I couldn&#8217;t resist throwing
  in some <i>Shaquanda</i> hot sauce as well.  What they don&#8217;t know won&#8217;t
  hurt them, right?</p>
<p>We retired to the couch to watch a little more of <i>Aliens</i>.  The
  further we watch, the more Marissa and I are convinced we had never
  actually scene this second movie in the series.  I would have
  certainly remembered it being this bad.  In the movie, Ripley goes
  with an elite squad of space Marines to go handle an alien outbreak on
  the colony, but these space Marines practically act like a high school
  football team.  They complain, interrupt their officer all the time,
  and refuse to take anything seriously.  &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t they just fire these
  people?  Isn&#8217;t this the Marines?&#8221; I questioned.  &#8220;Why are they chewing
  gum, throwing things, and acting like kids stuck in after school
  detention?&#8221;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  As a family, we agreed to lay low at
  least until lunch, reserving the afternoon for - Marissa&#8217;s words -
  <i>something crazy</i>.  What does crazy mean?  I floated the idea of
  bowling, but perhaps that&#8217;s not exotic enough for a Monday afternoon
  without work.  Rodney seems to be in a video game mood today, so the
  arcade or Dave &amp; Buster&#8217;s is always an option.  Or maybe we&#8217;ll just
  hang out outside and pelt the side of the house with snowballs.
  Truthfully, we could do anything on this day off - the only way to
  waste it is to do something we don&#8217;t enjoy.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Happy MLK day, and hope you
  do something you enjoy.</p>
