<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, my brave weekend warriors.  I can&#8217;t believe we made it
  to Friday, and I can&#8217;t believe that somewhere in all of this we had a
  day off on Monday.  Martin Luther King Jr. Day feels like it happened
  a century ago.  This week was a real slog, but as usual, I&#8217;m happy to
  be here writing a crisp new journal entry at my desk - right where I&#8217;m
  supposed to be.</p>
<p>My calendar reports that it is day 1 of 3 in <i>WATER SLIDE WEEKEND</i>.
  I&#8217;m sure Rodney will be bouncing off the walls even more than he was
  yesterday.  He&#8217;s had some trouble grasping the difference between
  future tense and past tense.  Sometimes on our way to Hy-Vee, I&#8217;ll ask
  &#8220;did you and momma go to Canine Sports Zone?&#8221;, and he&#8217;ll get
  frustrated with me.  &#8220;Dad no!  Not Sports Zone.  Hy-Vee,&#8221; he&#8217;ll reply,
  as if he&#8217;s trying to snap me out of a stupor.  All that to say it will
  be much easier for him to grasp &#8220;Alice is coming <i>Today</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p>I too can&#8217;t wait for water slide weekend.  Yesterday, after taking off
  for the afternoon, I went to the market to pick up dinner and some
  ingredients needed to make a double batch of deep dish pizza.  I had a
  whole hour to kill, so I didn&#8217;t even bother to make a comprehensive
  grocery list, instead opting to just lazily walk up and down each
  aisle, <i>eventually</i> getting everything I needed.  Pizza is the name of
  the game this evening, but last night feeling burnt out from the busy
  week, I wanted to make seafood stew.  I picked up some cod, scallops,
  and frozen mussels.  While checking out, the cashier commented &#8220;looks
  like a special night!&#8221;  The small invasion of privacy flustered me.  I
  don&#8217;t like it when cashiers comment on what I&#8217;m buying, unless I
  invite them to do so.  &#8220;Yeah, my sister is coming to visit, and she
  wants to try my pizza,&#8221; I replied, and as the words left my mouth, I
  thought <i>What the hell does that have to do with anything?</i>.  The
  cashier looked down at the groceries, then looked at me, brow furrowed
  with concern.  Then it hit me - she assumed that I was somehow going
  to make a pizza from scallops, mussels, cod, and fennel.  &#8220;Half of
  this is just for tonight.  The pizza is tomorrow.&#8221;  The cashier
  laughed, &#8220;OK I was confused for a second there!&#8221;  You see?  This is
  why we don&#8217;t comment on what I&#8217;m buying.  It leads us to logistics,
  and logistics make for tedious small talk.  If we had stuck to the
  basics, like commenting on the weather, or even giving me crap about
  the Bears logo stuck to the back of my car, we could have avoided this
  whole mess.</p>
<p>Back at home with a whole two hours before our evening session of Kids
  Code, I put on some music and got to cooking.  I cut the seafood up
  into chunks and dusted it with old bay, setting it aside in the
  fridge.  I sliced the fennel, garlic, and parsley.  I poured the
  canned tomatoes and clam juice in a blender, and just for fun I added
  a generous squirt of balsamic vinegar.  Everything was ready to go,
  but it was only 4:30, so I&#8217;d have to spend the next fifteen minutes
  just puttering around the kitchen keeping the stew on a simmer.</p>
<p>Rodney and Marissa emerged from their afternoon naps and joined me at
  the table.  As Marissa and I slurped away, Rodney studied a mussel
  shell at the end of his fork.  &#8220;Open it up and eat what&#8217;s inside,
  dude,&#8221; I encouraged him.  Rodney stubbornly dropped the mussel back in
  his soup and instead reached for another chunk of warm bread.</p>
<p>&#8220;This meal is always better than I expect it to be,&#8221; said Marissa.
  Her eyes widened, hearing the sharp edges of that conversation opener.
  &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; she said back peddling.  &#8220;I mean <i>fish stew</i>
  just doesn&#8217;t sound like a good thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I know what you mean,&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;This is a meal for me.  I
  think I like making this when I&#8217;m sad or tired, and I appreciate you
  guys eating it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I departed at 5:30 sharp for Kids Code, sloshing through wet snow and
  carrying my heavy IT bin on my hip.  The <i>Thursday scaries</i> were in
  full swing.  I didn&#8217;t feel like being social, and for the entire walk
  over I thought about nothing but my eventual walk back to my house
  that would occur two hours later.</p>
<p>I unpacked my stuff, set up the laptops, and introduced myself to some
  new volunteers.  Kids started trickling in and began quietly working.
  I greeted everyone, welcomed them back from the long holiday break,
  and off we went working on games.  I had so much fun checking in on
  everyone&#8217;s side projects, it made me feel guilty for my reluctance and
  dinner table griping.  Freddie was working on a new game called <i>E &amp;
  P&#8217;s Excellent Adventure.</i> &#8220;It&#8217;s a two player game where you and a
  friend play as my brothers, Evan and Phillip, and it&#8217;s kind of like
  Mario, only more violent.&#8221;  A small, delicately drawn ascii character
  lept off a platform and fell onto spikes, exploding into a mist of
  yellow liquid.  &#8220;I changed the color of the blood.  I think I made it
  <i>too</i> violent,&#8221; Freddie smirked.</p>
<p>Cord and his friend he brought from school were working on a 3D
  platformer.  Cord asked me to demo his game, and I was having so much
  fun I lost track of time and played for a whole ten minutes.  &#8220;Oh man,
  I&#8217;ve been here for a while, I need to&#8230; you know&#8230; make the rounds,&#8221;
  I said as I collected just a few more coins.</p>
<p>Later, I brainstormed with Moe about a new concept game he was working
  on.  &#8220;So you&#8217;re a kid, and your family keeps asking you to do things,&#8221;
  Moe explained.  &#8220;And the goal of the game is to be so bad at helping
  that they stop asking you for things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they call that <i>strategic incompetence</i>,&#8221; I laughed.  &#8220;That&#8217;s
  like a Dilbert term for when you&#8217;re bad at something on purpose so you
  don&#8217;t get more responsibility.&#8221;  Moe&#8217;s eyes lit up.  I repeated the
  term for him.  &#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to call my game.  <i>Strategic
  Incompetence</i>,&#8221; he said, and I was honored to contribute.</p>
<p>After our session, I packed the room, thanked the volunteers, then
  walked back home.  I had so much fun at Kids Code that I actually kind
  of felt ashamed for my earlier reluctance.  Kids have amazing ideas
  and they can be so creative, and it&#8217;s a privilege just to be there.</p>
<p>Have a great Friday, everyone.</p>
