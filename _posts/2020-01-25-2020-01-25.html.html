excerpt: dog parties, cloudmigos, and kelly and jeremy

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you are having a wonderful Saturday so
  far.  This morning, the words of Dr. Seuss come to mind - <i>A dog</i>
  <i>party!  Big dogs, little dogs, black dogs, white dogs, yellow dogs,/
  /blue dogs, and red dogs are all at a dog party.  What a dog party!</i>
  I&#8217;m referring to, of course, Ollie and Ziggy running around the house
  and playing with Kelly and Jeremy&#8217;s dogs, Jo-Jo &amp; Becca.  This
  morning, the house feels like a big wonderful dog party.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as I was straightening things up and brewing coffee, Rodney
  and his cousins sat at the table nibbling on stroopwafels and cereal.
  Rodney would chime in with a half phrase, Frankie would reply with
  some indecipherable baby talk, and then Alice would deliver an
  illogical punchline that made all three of them erupt in laughter.
  &#8220;They remind me of some rascally old people,&#8221; I said.  Jeremy smiled.
  &#8220;Yeah, the kind that would get in trouble at a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts or
  something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday was a good day.  In the morning, I worked the support queue,
  then worked on some old servers we were planning to decommission.  I
  ran the commands to shut them down, then stared at the flickering
  graph of active requests and errors.  It swelled, then trended down,
  holding just below 100.  &#8220;Ah dammit,&#8221; I growled, hunched over my
  keyboard.  If the graph didn&#8217;t consistently read zero, that meant
  other services still expected these things to be up, and we&#8217;d have to
  track them down and try again later.  With lunch time encroaching, I
  begrudgingly turned them back on.  &#8220;Better safe than sorry,&#8221; I
  announced to my team.  &#8220;Plus I want to enjoy my lunch, I don&#8217;t want
  this causing an issue 45 minutes from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had planned a special reunion lunch that day with the original
  cloud team - or <i>the cloudmigos</i> as we called ourselves.  Rob, Alex,
  and I walked over to DELUX, ordered some beer, and soon Huttleston
  joined us.  Famished from the long morning, I wolfed down my chicken
  sandwich in about four bites, then helped myself to fries and fried
  pickles.  Over a round of Zombie Dust beers, we reminisced about a
  simpler time in Zendesk&#8217;s infrastructure when it was just the four of
  us at that table, for the most part, winging everything.  We had
  simple beginnings, but almost four years later our jobs look much
  different now, and it&#8217;s amazing to reflect on all the different teams,
  processes, and new technologies that have followed.</p>
<p>After lunch, we slowly made our way back to the office.  I had some
  more meetings, but the day started to wind down, concluding with our
  team&#8217;s end of the week retrospective.  Fong presented some Foundation
  Engineering t shirts she made.  &#8220;I was afraid I was going to get in
  trouble for using the logo,&#8221; she said nervously, passing the shirts
  around the room.  &#8220;Ah, so they&#8217;re knock-offs!&#8221; I teased.  &#8220;You&#8217;re
  totally fine.  We might sue you, but we probably won&#8217;t - don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;
  And for a knock-off Zendesk shirt, it&#8217;s a good shirt.  Having just
  gutted my closet of old shirts, I was grateful to add another crisp,
  clean, white t shirt to my wardrobe.</p>
<p>I made my way outside and jumped on a bus.  Sighing, slumping down in
  my seat, and shutting my eyes, I was grateful to be done with the work
  day, but my lack of energy worried me.  Kelly and Jeremy were on their
  way to our house, and feeling burnt out from the long work day, I
  wasn&#8217;t sure how I would rally.  As I entered the house, Marissa was
  cleaning, Rodney was playing, and I got to making pizza.  The moment I
  could smell the minced garlic hit the hot olive oil, I felt the spark
  of a good mood.  &#8220;I think I just needed to make some pizza sauce,&#8221; I
  announced to Marissa, who was busily cleaning and putting things away
  around me.  &#8220;Pizza sauce always puts me in a good mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly and Jeremy would arrive much later in the night, which gave me
  plenty of time to assemble the pizzas with care.  This was the first
  double batch of sauce I&#8217;d make.  It took much longer to simmer down to
  the right consistency, and it took on a much more mysterious and dark
  color - which worried me.  I tasted the sauce on a spoon, and to my
  relief, it was still sweet and light, like a caprese salad.</p>
<p>I baked the pizzas, then left them on the table to cool.  Kelly and
  Jeremy arrived, and a flurry of dogs, children, and joy filled the
  house.  After settling in, I coaxed the pizzas out of the cast iron
  pans onto a cutting board.  Marissa caught me fist pumping in the
  kitchen from the corner of her eye.  &#8220;Getting deep dish out of the pan
  is like my white whale,&#8221; I explained.  I&#8217;ve tried many times, and the
  results have always been disastrous.</p>
<p>We ate at the table, then after putting all the kids to bed, we
  cracked open some beers and stood outside on the deck while the dogs
  played in the snow.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t drink any beer until the kids are in
  bed,&#8221; Jeremy explained, rocking on his heels outside on the deck.
  &#8220;I&#8217;d much rather relax when I no longer have a job to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the same way,&#8221; I replied, nodding along.  It&#8217;s nothing against
  Rodney or the kids, but beer just tastes better after they go to bed,
  doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>We floated from the deck, to the kitchen, and to the living room,
  sharing stories and talking about the week.  &#8220;It&#8217;s been an emotionally
  charged week,&#8221; Kelly explained as Jeremy nodded in agreement.  Work
  stress take many forms, and it&#8217;s always illuminating hearing how it&#8217;s
  manifested for someone, whether they&#8217;re directing a team, drilling
  teeth, trying to shut off old servers, or working on a painting that&#8217;s
  larger than your studio.</p>
<p>By the sound of it, things are starting to wind down in the living
  room.  Paw Patrol is playing on the TV, and every now and then I&#8217;ll
  here the pattering and rapping of dog feet on the wood floor.  Kelly
  and Jeremy are fun guest, and if you&#8217;ve never had them, I&#8217;d highly
  recommend it.  &#8220;You guys aren&#8217;t even company,&#8221; I explained last night.
  The more they spend time with you, the more energy they give back to
  you, it seems.</p>
<p>Well we&#8217;ve finally reached the long anticipated Water Slide Day.  In a
  few moments, we&#8217;ll pack lunches, change into suits, and hit the road
  for the great Wisconsin Dells.  I can only imagine Rodney&#8217;s
  excitement, spending the last months thinking, watching videos, and
  dreaming about water slides.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day.</p>
