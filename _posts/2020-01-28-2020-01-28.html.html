<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  I hope you woke up feeling better than I do.
  Right now my energy level is pretty low.  Just as I was coming home
  from work yesterday, I started to come down with a sore throat, and
  this morning I woke up feeling pretty crummy.  After some anguishing,
  I decided to take a sick day home from work.  The unfortunate thing is
  that I still have an osteo appointment at 8:40, meaning I still need
  to get ready and leave the house this morning at the same time I
  normally do.  Do you still to go a scheduled doctor&#8217;s appointment if
  you&#8217;re feeling sick?  Something about sitting in a small room exposing
  a healthy young doctor to a crummy sore throat doesn&#8217;t feel right, but
  I&#8217;d imagine he&#8217;s around that kind of thing all day anyway.</p>
<p>The timing actually isn&#8217;t bad.  Today was <i>spine manipulation</i> day,
  and at least now I have the whole day to recover in case he really
  does a number on my back.  I trust the process, and I really think
  they know what they&#8217;re doing, but even the &#8220;mini session&#8221; he did last
  appointment left me feeling really sore, so part of me is anticipating
  a painful, cathartic response.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to taking a day to sleep and heal.  Rolling right
  from a hectic week of ticket duty to kids code to a busy water slide
  weekend finally caught up with me.  I&#8217;ll spend the rest of the
  afternoon just getting as much sleep as I can, then hopefully I&#8217;ll
  feel good enough to throw together some soup for dinner or something.
  Maybe tonight we&#8217;ll make pasta fazoule.  I could go for a spicy,
  warming one-pot meal.</p>
<p>Minor declination of health aside, yesterday was a pretty good day.
  It was a meeting heavy day - one of those days where we had something
  tough to design as a team, and also struggled to find time to discuss
  it.  We spent the day wheeling the same little whiteboard around to
  different rooms, meeting in thirty minute sessions between everyone
  else&#8217;s schedule.</p>
<p>For lunch, I walked over to my favorite food cart, but seeing it
  hadn&#8217;t yet opened, I decided to walk a little further to Collectivo
  and check out their lunch menu.  I bought an avocado BLT on sourdough,
  and it came with these really tasty potato chips.  I ate my lunch
  quietly in the break room while I moved some more recipes over to the
  online cookbook.  Kelly was kind enough to share pictures she took of
  my french toast, which looked infinitely more appealing than what I
  had cropped out of a blurry picture I took on this past Christmas
  morning.</p>
<p>It was also pointed out to me that I spelled &#8220;cayenne&#8221; wrong all
  throughout the leek &amp; potato soup recipe I added.  I spelled each like
  &#8220;cyan&#8221; - the color.  That&#8217;s an especially nasty typo because it has
  worked its way into my muscle memory.  My fingers think &#8220;cyan&#8221; is a
  spice, and my brain must think it looks close enough.  That gave me an
  idea for a plugin.  Since &#8220;cyan&#8221; is one of many reoccurring typos I
  struggle with, it might not be a bad idea to keep them in a watch list
  and make my text editor prompt me <i>Are you sure you wanted to say
  cyan, the color</i> when I try saving the document I&#8217;m writing.  If only
  Clippy, the cartoon paperclip mascot of Microsoft Word, were still
  around in my daily life.  This type of thing is probably his bread and
  butter.</p>
<p>Confession: I talk about <i>Clippy</i> fondly as if he were a big part of
  my paper writing career in high school, but between you and me I
  switched our family computer to the dog cartoon instead, which had a
  much less memorable animation set.  Clippy could dance and form
  himself into shapes like a cowboy hat or an airplane, and all the dog
  did was prance and lick the screen.</p>
<p>After lunch, I had a code screen in the late afternoon, and just as I
  finished up, I started to feel a distant scratch in my throat.  I
  suppose the timing worked out, because at that point I was practically
  all finished talking for the day, and I could spend the rest of the
  day filling out a code screen evaluation and working on my work goals
  for the first half of the year.</p>
<p>After work, I took the bus home.  Rodney greeted me enthusiastically
  at his door upstairs, and I did my best to match his energy.  &#8220;He
  missed you today,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;He&#8217;s really excited about going to
  Hy-Vee.&#8221;</p>
<p>We jumped in the car to pick up dinner.  Marissa&#8217;s stomach has been
  upset lately, so I gave her the full control of the dinner menu.
  &#8220;Just close your eyes and picture what you want on your plate,&#8221; I
  asked earlier over slack.  She came up with chicken, potatoes, and a
  kale salad.</p>
<p>Before Rodney and I walked into Hy-Vee, our friend from the meat
  counter bumped into us outside on his way to tend to the smoker.  He
  offered to let us look inside and waft some free smells.  He opened
  the metal door, revealing about 100 chicken wings bathing in the wet
  smoke.  &#8220;I never get tired of that smell,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I do,&#8221; replied the butcher.  &#8220;I can&#8217;t even put my hat on at
  home, the smell gets really obnoxious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you could overdue anything,&#8221; I said.  I could believe that.
  I haven&#8217;t smoked much on my grill this season.  I like the smell, but
  honestly I was just making small talk.</p>
<p>Rodney and I picked up groceries and headed home.  I cooked some
  chicken breasts and potatoes and tossed a kale salad with strawberries
  and cucumbers.  We put Rodney to bed, then feeling better from a good
  dinner, got some chores done before crashing on the couch.  I prepared
  a cup of decaf green tea spiked with some tequila.  &#8220;Can you put
  tequila in tea?&#8221; I asked Marissa.  She shrugged her shoulders, and I
  dropped a half shot in my mug and took a sip.  &#8220;Yes you can,&#8221; I said
  completing my own thought.  It felt good to rest, and I&#8217;m looking
  forward to resting again in the same way.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  I&#8217;m going to shower, go to the doctor, then
  go back to sleep.  I hope you have a great day today.  Stay healthy,
  drink water, and get plenty of sleep.  Thanks for reading, and happy
  Tuesday.</p>
