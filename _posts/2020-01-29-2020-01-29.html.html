excerpt: ramen, realignment, and king of the hill

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  I hope you are feeling healthy and strong,
  and having a productive week.  This morning, I&#8217;m far from 100%, but
  I&#8217;m going to try to jump on line and do some work.  If I had to go
  into the office today, I wouldn&#8217;t dream of it, but since Wednesday is
  usually my work from home day, I think I can manage.  I have a code
  screen right before lunch, but for the rest of the day I&#8217;m pretty much
  free to find something to work on.</p>
<p>This is probably the sickest I&#8217;ve ever been since I began daily
  journaling, and I&#8217;m not going to lie, I thought I would have to really
  dig deep this morning finding something to talk about.  But I&#8217;m
  pleasantly surprised that writing doesn&#8217;t really take a lot of energy
  for me these days.  After all, I&#8217;ve rambled about how writing is kind
  of like a muscle, and following through with that analogy, muscles get
  stronger, and soon they don&#8217;t take as much energy to do the same
  amount of work.  Or it could just be the Day-quill kicking in.  I&#8217;ve
  been popping those things like candy, and I think the dose I took with
  my first cup of coffee is giving me some wings.</p>
<p>So yesterday morning, I still had to leave the house at practically
  the same time I do on every Tuesday.  I was dreading social
  interaction of any kind, even small talk with a doctor.  But focused
  on climbing back into bed after the appointment, I resolved to just
  get through it.</p>
<p>My doctor is a tall, young guy, and I had forgotten how chatty he was.
  Lucky for me, he was the kind of chatty that can carry a conversation
  solo.  As he dispensed instructions on where to sit, stand, lie, and
  bend over, he rambled about his profession and the benefits of the
  spine manipulation he performs.</p>
<p>&#8220;This feels tender right here,&#8221; he said, gently patting a spot in my
  upper back.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve felt a twinge there for a while,&#8221; I said.  He
  guided my arms up to my chest, then gently and systematically torqued
  my back up and to the left.  The twinge spot on my back lit up,
  flooded with the warmth of a good stretch.  &#8220;That one was a real
  puzzle,&#8221; I said through a grimace.  I didn&#8217;t even know it was possible
  to stretch that part of your back.</p>
<p>As I laid back on the table, the doctor grabbed the balls of my feet
  and compared them.  &#8220;Did you know one leg is a little longer than the
  other?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;That would be news to me,&#8221; I said, cracking a wry,
  unseen smirk from my end of the examination table.  &#8220;I think it&#8217;s
  probably just your hips, let me see if I can realign them.&#8221;  The
  doctor pressed down on my hips, like he was giving them CPR.  The
  tingling sensation made me squirm.  Feeling my hips crunch under his
  arms, I suddenly felt so fragile and carnal, like a piece of meat
  lying on a butcher&#8217;s table.  He concluded the session by stretching my
  legs in a circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be kind of a workout for you, huh?  I&#8217;m a big dude&#8230;&#8221; I
  said as he hoisted my leg in the air.  The doctor interrupted me with
  an observation.  &#8220;Nah,&#8221; he said heaving my other leg in the air.
  &#8220;Young healthy guys like you are actually a lot of fun to work on.
  Your body responds to what we do immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thanked the doctor and he sent me on my way.  It&#8217;s hard to judge if
  the therapy did anything for my spasms, since they have already
  subsided from taking daily magnesium supplements, but either way, I
  was eagerly looking forward to heading home for a nap.  Coming home, I
  trudged upstairs and crumpled back into bed, sleeping through the rest
  of the morning.</p>
<p>I woke up some time around noon.  Rodney was playing in our bed,
  trying to read me books.  After shrugging him off of me, I relocated
  downstairs to the couch to watch TV.  I ran out of YouTube videos to
  watch, then spent some time looking for new cooking channels to
  follow.  I came up empty, I think my usual set of Chef John, Stefan,
  Maangchi, Bruno, Munchies, and sometimes Babish is too complete.
  Giving up, I instead put <i>King of the Hill</i> on shuffle.  It would
  remain on the rest of the day.  I can&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;m the only one who
  has a TV show reserved for sick days.  <i>King of the Hill</i> is slow.
  There&#8217;s not many surprises, but it&#8217;s still satisfying, like a big bowl
  of chicken soup for your brain.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, I journeyed to the kitchen to make a bowl of
  spicy ramen for lunch.  Marissa was in the kitchen putting groceries
  away.  I dabbed some hot sauce into the hot broth while the noodles
  simmered.  Marissa started coughing from the aroma.  &#8220;What did you put
  in that?&#8221; asked Marissa through teary eyes.  &#8220;Just some hot sauce,&#8221; I
  laughed.  &#8220;I wanted to flush my nose out - you know I can&#8217;t even smell
  that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I laid on the couch through the rest of the afternoon, finally getting
  up to make dinner at six.  Despite feeling fatigued and achy, the
  routine of preparing dinner carried me like a slow train.  We ate
  pasta fazoul at the dinner table.</p>
<p>I limped through my dutch lesson, then returned to the couch for the
  rest of the night.  I opened a beer thinking it might help settle my
  stomach, but I soon regretted it and switched back to tea.  Laying on
  the couch under a blanket, I could hear Marissa running the sink and
  cleaning dishes.  Cleaning the dishes, taking care of Rodney, and
  picking up groceries, Marissa was the hero of my sick day.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m feeling just barely well enough to work.  I&#8217;m hoping that I
  can take a story and quietly chip away at it from the couch.  I&#8217;ll
  have to dig deep to find the energy to do a code screen, but it
  shouldn&#8217;t be so bad.  Right now, I&#8217;m looking forward to shutting my
  laptop at 4, and maybe stealing a nap.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m thinking of everyone else reading this.  You probably
  didn&#8217;t get to stay home yesterday, and it&#8217;s just a regular work week
  for you.  I don&#8217;t like when we can&#8217;t bond and commiserate together
  over each day of the work week, but we&#8217;re both here now.  It&#8217;s
  Wednesday - the week is practically half way over and before you know
  it, it will be the weekend and we can all nap to our heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great day today.  Drink plenty of water and take lots
  of breaks to stretch your back and arms.</p>
