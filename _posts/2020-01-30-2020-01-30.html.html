excerpt: dumplings, rodney's favorites, and the blanket game
---
<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re feeling healthy and strong today.
  As for me, I&#8217;m feeling a little bit better.  At this point, the sore
  throat left, and I&#8217;m just dealing with an obnoxious cough, a cold, and
  some fatigue.  While not yet at 100%, I think I&#8217;m well enough to head
  into work today.  I think as long as I keep the cough drops close by,
  I&#8217;ll manage just fine.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty alright day.  I was able to keep a low profile
  working from home, chipping away at a ticket and eventually summoning
  the energy to conduct a code screen.  It went well, but it took a lot
  out of me, and things kind of slowed down in the afternoon, but I hung
  in there until quitting time.</p>
<p>Marissa was kind enough to pick up groceries again.  Having had the
  same cough/cold virus, I&#8217;m looking forward to the stage she is at that
  evidently gives you a boost of productive energy.  &#8220;Today is the first
  day I don&#8217;t feel sick at all,&#8221; she said.  For me, that should only be
  a few days from now.</p>
<p>For dinner, I decided to make dumplings.  This surprised Marissa,
  since the last time I made dumplings it was kind of a big production
  that involved two people.  But Chef John has a <i>lazy dumpling</i> recipe
  where he makes a dozen at a time by essentially just making one long
  <i>saucijzenbroodje</i> from pork and dough, then &#8220;karate chopping&#8221; it into
  smaller pieces.  The dough was a little tricky, but all in all it
  wasn&#8217;t so bad.  You can really tell Chef John is a pro because of the
  way he makes do.  He uses one hand to knead and mop up the extra flour
  in the bowl, so that by the time he&#8217;s done he can just drop the dough
  ball in the same bowl and let it rest.  My bowl, in comparison, was
  caked with wet flour, and I had to scrub it out in the sink before I
  could reuse it.  I also made way too much dough.</p>
<p>All throughout mixing and kneading the dough in the kitchen, I coughed
  uncontrollably.  I imagine my barking and wheezing could be heard all
  throughout the house, and even though Marissa and Rodney have probably
  already been exposed to this cruddy virus, I could only imagine how
  uncomfortable it must have been hearing someone cough all over your
  dinner.  It kind of had the same energy as that scene from the Office
  where Dwight insists the rest of the office cough and sneeze on his
  things so he can develop a better immunity.</p>
<p>With my cantaloupe sized dough ball resting in plastic, the ground
  pork marinating in ginger, garlic, and soy sauce, and the white rice
  drying over the sink in a colander, I had a whole hour to kill before
  assembly.  I could have probably squeezed in a nap, but I instead
  chose to enjoy a cup of tea on the couch and watch some TV.  It felt
  good to just sit and not think about anything.</p>
<p>An hour later, I got up to finish making dinner.  I flattened the
  dough, rolled a dense center of pork, and pinched the thin surface
  shut, sealing it with some water.  I heated up my biggest pan with
  sesame oil and butter, then seared the dumplings for a few minutes.  I
  guess at that point, they were potstickers, and true to their name,
  they stuck right to the bottom of my pan.</p>
<p>And the great thing about potstickers is that once you put them down
  in the pan, you don&#8217;t have to touch them again.  Instead of prying
  them free, I dumped in glass of chicken broth seasoned with soy sauce
  and mirin.  Steam billowed from the pan up to my ceiling, sputtering
  and hissing before dying down to a simmer.  I covered the dumplings
  and cranked the heat.  They gently bobbed in the broth as the lid
  fogged up, but the smell still leaked out.</p>
<p>I transferred the dumplings to the only Chinese looking bowl we own in
  the house, then dredged them in broth.  We ate it with a side of white
  rice, and giving the rice extra time to drain and dry off made for a
  noticeable improvement.  I ate my dumplings with a dab of Korean chili
  paste.</p>
<p>Halfway through eating, Rodney interrupted us, proudly announcing
  &#8220;Hey, I like this!&#8221;  He had already picked his bowl clean of any
  ground pork, and all that remained was a little bed of white rice and
  some shreds of dumpling dough.  I smiled at Marissa.  &#8220;That makes me
  happy,&#8221; I said to her.  &#8220;I like keeping track of what meals he likes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he likes anything with pork,&#8221; she laughed.  &#8220;He&#8217;s pork boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true.  Rodney&#8217;s favorites are a high profile, exclusive list, and
  thus far they only include peanut butter and jelly cut into triangles,
  pork chops, and now pork dumplings.  Occasionally, he&#8217;ll ask for a
  soft boiled egg, but I think he&#8217;s more interesting in peeling them
  over the sink than he is in actually eating them.</p>
<p>Marissa put Rodney to bed and let me get an early jump on chores.
  &#8220;Don&#8217;t push yourself too hard,&#8221; she warned.  Truth be told, I don&#8217;t
  mind putting things away in the kitchen.  On most nights, cleaning up
  the kitchen is as relaxing to me as being on the computer.  It&#8217;s a
  form of meditation.  I moved slowly between tasks, taking plenty of
  breaks to check in on Marissa and Rodney or push some fluids.</p>
<p>After Rodney was in bed, while I was waiting for oven to heat up so I
  could clean the stove, I decided to be a spectator of the dogs&#8217;
  <i>blanket game</i>, which is a clever game-ification of their dinner
  designed to teach them to respect each other&#8217;s training time.  Both
  dogs sit on a folded blanket, and Marissa will do tricks with one of
  the dogs, using a piece of kibble as motivation.  If the other dog
  stays put on the blanket, they are rewarded with a piece of kibble as
  well.  I tried playing a round.  It was difficult finding the
  coordination to dispense commands to two dogs at once, but it was fun.
  I felt like a lion tamer or something.  I used to tease Marissa for
  making the dogs to tricks for their dinner, but I could see now that
  they look forward to the blanket game.  &#8220;They actually love it,&#8221; she
  said.  &#8220;It puts me in a good mood too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like their own little game show with food,&#8221; I remarked.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling rested today.  I spent the rest of the evening pushing
  fluids and vitamins like a maniac, and if I had to guess, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m
  at a solid B right now.  I&#8217;m grateful it&#8217;s Thursday, and by the time I
  start feeling completely better, it will be the weekend.  That&#8217;s
  something to look forward too.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.  Hope you have a great day today.</p>
