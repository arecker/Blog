<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Friday, and likewise, happy last day of
  January.  This morning, I hope you are all feeling as good as I am.
  My soar throat is a distant memory, and at this point I&#8217;m just dealing
  with a <i>booger</i> situation.</p>
<p>I felt well enough to go to work yesterday, but I was still teased for
  showing up.  Catching me making sniffling sounds at morning stand-up,
  the team gave me some light harassment about coming into work and
  threatening their health.  &#8220;No seriously, I feel great - I wouldn&#8217;t be
  here if I did,&#8221; I contested.  &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; replied my boss.
  &#8220;Because you even look kind of sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well now I have no choice but to be offended, since this is what I
  look like when I feel good,&#8221; I shot back.  I still did my best to keep
  out of peoples&#8217; way, opening doors with my feet and washing my hands
  every time I passed the sink.  That coronavirus must have people on
  high alert for any kind of disease.  In fact, my work just announced
  that anyone who has been to China recently needs to work from home for
  the same amount of time.  Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have coronavirus.</p>
<p>After stand-up, my coworker Fong kindly offered me some ginseng.  Fong
  is from China, and I&#8217;ve come to learn that the Chinese take tea very
  seriously.  I&#8217;ve written before about team &#8220;tea time&#8221;, in which Fong
  shows up her elaborate ritual for brewing matcha.  She handed me a
  small silver tin with a dozen little brown twigs rolling around
  inside.  &#8220;Pick three good ones, put them in some hot water, and add a
  little bit of honey,&#8221; she instructed.  The tea was so powerful, I
  could have sworn the inside of my mouth went numb, and all at once I
  felt a tremendous burst of productive energy.  I spent the rest of the
  morning writing code at my desk, enjoying the clean caffeine buzz of
  pure ginseng before I got up to make some lunch.</p>
<p>I heated up a bowl of Korean instant ramen in the kitchen and returned
  to my desk.  I hadn&#8217;t had this ramen in a while.  Korean ramen
  activates memories of working at Healthgrades.  Before I cooked so
  much, I used to fill my cubicle cabinet with packets of instant Korean
  ramen, each with their own interesting colors, graphics, and seasoning
  packets.  I still enjoy it every once in a while.  Unlike the cheap
  maruchan stuff you&#8217;d buy at Target, Korean instant ramen is closer to
  a real meal.  I took the bowl of spicy noodles to my desk, enjoying
  some YouTube videos, then winding down with a bottle of iced tea.</p>
<p>I had some meetings, then concluded the day with a short coding war
  room, where Fong, Alex, and I performed a data migration that was on
  the complicated side and needed more than just one set of eyes.  I
  ducked out just in time to jump on the bus homeward.</p>
<p>Back at home, I triumphantly rolled my backpack on the ground and
  collapsed onto the couch, where Marissa was sleeping with Ziggy under
  the blanket.  I proceeded to surf some YouTube videos, soaking up the
  extra time between coming home and going out to eat.  Marissa awoke to
  me watching an interview with Jay Cutler.  &#8220;This interview was
  dissapointing,&#8221; I griped.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why everyone was going nuts
  about it on reddit, it&#8217;s just Jay Cutler bragging about how he would
  probably be really good at olympic handball.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney awoke, and after I got him out of bed, he too joined us on the
  couch.  We packed the dogs away and jumped in the car, bound for
  Portillo&#8217;s.  &#8220;I haven&#8217;t eaten much this week,&#8221; I said to Marissa while
  we were waiting in line to order.  &#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to get the
  ribs.&#8221;  Marissa smiled in approval.</p>
<p>After finishing up at Portillo&#8217;s, we jumped back in the car and drove
  to Target.  Marissa needed to return something, and I suggested we
  pick up a gallon of milk.  As usual on Thursdays, we also decided to
  tool around the toy aisle and let Rodney check out the monster trucks
  and nerf guns.  His eye was drawn to the shoulder mounted sniper rifle
  nerf gun, which in the box, was about as long as he is tall.  &#8220;Rodney,
  if you can pick that up and point it at me, I&#8217;ll buy it for you on the
  spot,&#8221; teased Marissa.  I very much wanted to holder her to that.
  I&#8217;ve always been a fan of Rodney owning humongous toys that are
  inappropriate for his age.  You might recall that I bought him a Xena
  Warrior Princess sword that made sound effects when he was only two.
  And just as a two year old with a sword amused me, so did Rodney
  owning a high powered nerf sniper rifle.  But despite our best
  efforts, I couldn&#8217;t get him to hold up the heavy rifle, and we had to
  leave it at the store.</p>
<p>We headed home, and after putting Rodney to bed, I practiced Dutch,
  knocked out my push-ups and sit-ups, then trotted upstairs to rewire
  my IT shelf.  After discovering that the software I was using on my
  router could run off of a tiny USB stick, I realized I didn&#8217;t need the
  bulky metal case around the motherboard and could throw away the cheap
  hard drive.  I unboxed a new much simpler open case, which was just a
  piece of Plexiglas and screws that held the motherboard an inch above
  the shelf.  &#8220;Wow,&#8221; remarked Marissa as I was assembling it at my
  desk.  &#8220;That looks so much better.&#8221;</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the evening installing the software and wrapping
  cables, making an effort to demonstrate more patience.  Instead of
  wrapping every cable in tight coils around my fist, I tried to
  compromise with where the cable wanted to lie naturally, and I think
  it made the whole set up look more relaxed and free.  It sort of
  reminded me of the scene from Karate Kid where Mr. Miyagi is showing
  Daniel how to prune a bonsai tree.  Wrapping cables is much the same.</p>
<p>I booted the wall back up.  Fans whirred.  Lights flickered.  &#8220;Plex is
  working,&#8221; Marissa hollered from downstairs.  I raised my hands above
  my head in satisfaction.  &#8220;Practically a perfect game,&#8221; I boasted.  I
  just love it when you can turn things off and on, and they go back to
  doing what they were meant to do.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful Friday.  I&#8217;m looking forward to
  hanging out with Rodney this weekend while Marissa is at an agility
  trial, and of course watching the Superbowl this Sunday.  Godspeed,
  Jimmy Garoppolo.  I know you&#8217;ll make the northwest suburbs proud.</p>
