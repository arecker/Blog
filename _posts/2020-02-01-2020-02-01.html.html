<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning!  Welcome February!  Happy Saturday!  I hope everyone is
  feeling good today.  Even though we both know February will probably
  be just as cold and dark as January was, I think we can celebrate that
  we&#8217;re just a little closer to spring.</p>
<p>This morning, I woke up a little later to Rodney peeking his head out
  of his door yelling <i>Helloooooo</i> into the hallway.  He&#8217;s still very
  good about not leaving his room without our blessing, but this wake up
  call is the very latest in obedience workarounds.  I reluctantly
  crawled out of bed, changed him into some clean underwear, then went
  downstairs to take care of the dogs.</p>
<p>I set Rodney up on the couch with some Eggo waffles and sliced fruit,
  and soon enough Marissa joined us.  Later this morning, she&#8217;ll leave
  with Ziggy for an agility trial in Milwaukee, and we three boys will
  have to find something cool to do.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty swell Friday.  Our first half of the year goals
  were due yesterday, and being the last person remaining on our team
  who had not yet submitted them, I was relentlessly teased about it all
  morning.  &#8220;OK, I&#8217;ll remind you again in 10 minutes,&#8221; joked my boss.  I
  submitted my goals later that morning, garnering some sarcastic
  applause.</p>
<p>I coded through the morning, then went for a walk around the square.
  Lately, I&#8217;ve enjoyed eating at Collectivo.  I&#8217;ve always thought of
  them as a coffee place, but one day it struck me that half of their
  menu is food - sandwiches, wraps, salads, and even breakfast bowls,
  making for a pretty formidable lunch option when I&#8217;m in a pinch.  I
  treated myself to a potato, egg, and bacon breakfast burrito, finding
  a quiet place to sit in the office away from my desk and read up on
  the Bears off-season from my phone.</p>
<p>I had some meetings in the afternoon, concluding the work day with our
  team&#8217;s end of the week demo &amp; retro.  I shared my screen, taking my
  team through a tour of what I had worked on that week.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not
  finished yet, so the only running example I can show you is what the
  code does if there were <i>no</i> changes.&#8221;  I clicked a tab, flashing the
  message <code>No configuration changes, nothing to do!</code> on the screen.</p>
<p>Back at home, I got Rodney out of his room so we could go shopping.
  He was deep in sleep, and after waking he was in a pretty quiet mood.
  Usually chatting my ear off, this time on the drive over the only
  thing he mentioned was something about Paw Patrol Mac &#8216;n Cheese, which
  I later learned he had for lunch, liking it so much that he finished
  over half the box by himself.  A new inductee into Rodney&#8217;s
  favorites - and not a very surprising one either.</p>
<p>Rodney sat in the foot tray of our small grocery cart with his hood
  up, thinking and looking around while I shopped.  I picked up chicken
  legs, potatoes, and a bag of baby spinach.  I let Rodney pick out a
  chocolate egg as we were checking out.</p>
<p>Back at home, Rodney sat at the table expectantly, waiting for me to
  open his chocolate egg.  I peeled the wrapping, and out tumbled a tiny
  Hulk figurine.  &#8220;Green goblin!&#8221; exclaimed Rodney.  I&#8217;ve finally
  figured out Rodney&#8217;s system for super hero identification.  Every
  super hero is simply <i>ironman</i> - unless you&#8217;re dealing with the Hulk.
  He&#8217;s too big and too green to be mistaken for ironman, so we call him
  <i>green goblin</i>.  At least that one makes a little more sense.</p>
<p>As Marissa napped on the couch, I tossed the chicken legs and potatoes
  in lemon juice, garlic, oil, and spices, then arranged it in our
  roasting dish.  Hearing me in the kitchen, Rodney joined me and asked
  to help.  Together, we flipped and dredged the chicken legs in the
  oven, then got to work cutting up parsley and making a greek yogurt
  dressing.  He also nibbled on strawberries while I tossed the salad.
  &#8220;Rodney loves strawberries,&#8221; he stated between licking his fingers.
  &#8220;Yeah I know dude,&#8221; I replied, moving the rest of them out of his
  reach so he wouldn&#8217;t pick our salad clean before dinner.  Cooking
  seemed to improve his mood - Rodney was more talkative, and while we
  waited for the chicken to bake, we played some catch with his ball in
  the kitchen.</p>
<p>After dinner, we put Rodney to bed, and I knocked out some push-ups
  and sit-ups.  Even though it was a Friday night, I wanted to get at
  least one make up day in to account for being sick this week.  And I
  honestly like how the exercise makes me feel.  The push-ups are
  becoming easier, but I still struggle with the sit-ups.  &#8220;It&#8217;s weird,&#8221;
  I explained to Marissa the other night while she patiently sat on my
  feet for counter weight.  &#8220;I used to be much better at sit-ups.  I
  used to look forward to them because they were a break from the
  push-ups, which I hated.&#8221;</p>
<p>I finished Dutch, knocked out chores, and helped Marissa carefully
  move her resin tent in the basement, relocated earlier that day for a
  plumber who was checking our drain earlier that day.</p>
<p>After calling it a night, I worked on some code in the dining room
  while Marissa finished up.  I had a pretty fun day of coding
  yesterday.  I set up a secret store on my kubernetes cluster, and that
  should make it much simpler to add automated jobs and little web
  endpoints for our home.  Additionally, we&#8217;re starting some projects at
  work around the same type of technology, and I always enjoy work more
  when I can familiarize myself with the same stuff at home - with lower
  stakes, of course.</p>
<p>We concluded the night on the couch.  For her movie pick, Marissa
  picked the new Taylor Swift documentary on Netflix.  &#8220;I thought we&#8217;d
  like it, since we&#8217;ve both had a love-hate thing with Taylor Swift in
  the past,&#8221; said Marissa.  And we did like it.  The documentary was
  interesting.  It was packed with lots of intimate footage that shed
  light on why she was unhappy as a country singer, and what it felt
  like when people turned on her.  &#8220;It&#8217;s sad, I get that,&#8221; I narrated
  over the movie.  &#8220;But at some point, when celebrities complain about
  the Internet judging them, it kind of just sounds like their
  complaining about her job.  Blocking it out is a skill that she needs
  to develop more.&#8221;  Easy for me to say, I suppose.  I don&#8217;t think
  anyone has every said anything mean about me on the public Internet.
  I sympathize, but I think my point stands.</p>
<p>Last night was a late one.  Perhaps I was a little too excited about
  finally feeling good after a week of being sick.  I&#8217;m already eye
  balling the clock for an afternoon nap before Marissa gets home.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful day today.</p>
