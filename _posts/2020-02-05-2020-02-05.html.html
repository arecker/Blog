excerpt: funk, sausage, and bus stories

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing well today.  I&#8217;m feeling
  clear headed and strong this morning, and this Collectivo Brazilian
  blend of coffee is hitting me just right.  This morning, since I&#8217;m
  working from home for the day, I skipped the usual shower, and I had
  plenty of time to quietly sit at my desk with coffee and get my
  thoughts together.  To pair with the no-shower day, I&#8217;m wearing my
  favorite pair of sweats and my &#8216;hide-my-greasy-hair&#8217; beanie.  I&#8217;m
  already getting the sense that I&#8217;m not going anywhere today.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after finishing my blog post and kicking of the
  script that blasts it out to the Internet, I foolishly tried running a
  second script that syncs my notes to my work computer.  With my
  journal saved within my notes, they stepped on each other, and the
  three extra minutes it took me to fix things caused me to miss my bus.
  Just as I was walking around the corner, I saw the number 15 bus pull
  away.  I don&#8217;t miss my bus often, but the next time I do, I won&#8217;t be
  so worried.  The 6 runs only five minutes behind it, and it
  mysteriously reaches the square at the same time as the 15.  Don&#8217;t ask
  me why it works, but it does.</p>
<p>Work was sort of a thinking day.  I spent the morning mauling over the
  task I had taken that week, and after talking it over with the team
  and anguishing about it in our slack channel, I decided to stick it
  back in the backlog and take something else.  I get kind of restless
  when I go a few days without finishing something concrete.  Being
  Wednesday without anything to show for the week, the situation has put
  me in a minor funk.</p>
<p>I would love to be able to finish the same amount of work every day,
  but I guess that&#8217;s just not how work <i>works</i>.  Some weeks, you do more
  work than you&#8217;d normally do in a whole month, and some weeks feel like
  they slip away without anything to show for it.</p>
<p>I took a break at 11 to find a quiet place to eat my chicken noodle
  soup.  After gulping it down and cracking open an energy drink, I
  spent some time hacking on a home project - this week&#8217;s IT project
  card that I was falling behind on.  Karl and Heath joined me at the
  table, and later Julia, so I shut my laptop and chatted with them.
  Karl too has a kid on the way, and we&#8217;re both departing for paternity
  leave within a month of each other.  When I had my fill of small talk,
  I went for a quick walk around the square, then returned to my desk
  and worked through the rest of the afternoon.</p>
<p>I jumped off the bus, and Rodney was waiting for me by the back porch.
  He flung open the door, letting the dogs out, then ran down the porch
  stairs in his bare feet to greet me by the fence.  &#8220;I missed you
  dude!&#8221; I yelled hoisting him into the air.</p>
<p>As I unpacked my things, Marissa and I chatted about dinner plans.
  &#8220;I feel like making stamppot,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;You always feel like making
  stamppot,&#8221; Marissa laughed.  &#8220;Instead of sausage, can we do it with
  chicken?&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes.  &#8220;Then it&#8217;s no longer a one pot meal.  What if we do
  chicken sausage?&#8221; I countered.  Marissa wandered around in thought,
  then conceded.  &#8220;OK,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll try the chicken sausage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney and I went to Hy-Vee together.  He was in a great mood, and
  lately the cereal aisle gets him really pumped.  I asked him for his
  help in restocking our to-go breakfast cubbie by the coffee bar, and
  he jumped on the opportunity to pick out some cereal bars.  We went
  with chocolate oatmeal, and just to even things out, I picked up some
  fruit bars and an extra box of stroopwafels.</p>
<p>Back at home, I got to peeling potatoes and rinsing kale, and Marissa
  joined me in the kitchen to chat.  &#8220;I&#8217;m in kind of a funk this week at
  work,&#8221; I shared, as she sat on the shelf beside the counter,
  empathetically listening.  Sometimes, just talking somebody about a
  problem is it&#8217;s own solution - no solution necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, it&#8217;s about time to eat,&#8221; I said, jabbing a quartered potato
  with a fork and giving the cabbage a final toss.  As Marissa got
  Rodney and began setting the table, I mashed the potatoes and kale,
  blending them into a gentle green, buttery paste.  I&#8217;ve cut down on
  the amount of water in my stamppot recipe.  I used to fill the pot up
  and completely drain the potatoes before mashing them, but I think you
  get better color, flavor, and consistency if you try to preserve as
  much of the water is possible.  Instead of draining them in a
  colander, I leeched about a half cup of water out with a plastic cup
  and left the rest.</p>
<p>We ate at the dinner table, and after finishing our food, Marissa and
  I sat content while Rodney continued poking at his potatoes.  &#8220;How was
  the sausage?&#8221; I asked.  Marissa looked down at her plate.  &#8220;It was
  good,&#8221; she hesitated.  &#8220;I mean&#8230; as far as sausage goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>We sat in silence for another minute, then I decided to break into a
  bus story.  &#8220;So this really old guy today boarded the bus, and he was
  touching as many things as possible as he hobbled over to a seat,&#8221; I
  began, getting out of my chair to demonstrate.  &#8220;He found the seat
  next to me, sunk down, and rested his bony elbow right&#8230; here.&#8221;  I
  jabbed my elbow into Marissa&#8217;s side and glared at Rodney.  &#8220;He rode
  the last three of my stops like that, with his elbow digging into my
  side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa laughed, and Rodney joined in.  &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised you don&#8217;t
  complain about the bus more,&#8221; Marissa said.  &#8220;I think I would complain
  about it every day.&#8221;  Truthfully, the bus isn&#8217;t that bad.  Most days,
  everyone is a good citizen, and based on what I&#8217;ve observed, people
  love hearing bus stories.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll close this entry with my favorite bus story.  Let me take
  you back to last summer - it was hot and muggy, even in the morning.
  I was riding the 15 to work, and as usual, the 15 packed with standing
  room only.  Every seat was taken, except for a half seat beside a
  heavy set guy.  His head was rolled back, his legs were splayed out,
  and he was sleeping so deeply that he was practically snoring with his
  mouth open.  Being good, polite bus riders, everyone ignored the
  scene - except for this one hip guy wearing a tight black t-shirt and
  jeans.  He took out his phone, aimed it squarely at the heavy set guy,
  and snapped a picture.  His phone even made a quiet camera shutter
  sound.  My face turned beet red, and other people standing around
  started to feel uncomfortable.  <i>That&#8217;s terrible</i>, I thought.  <i>You
  can&#8217;t just take a</i> <i>picture of someone while they&#8217;re sleeping</i> <i>just
  to embarrass them.</i> <i>Should I confront him?  Will somebody else say
  something?</i></p>
<p>Tensions grew as the young guy smirked to himself.  I could tell he
  was sending the photo to somebody.  His fingers moved over the
  keyboard, as if he were writing a text.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the heavy set guy&#8217;s phone rang, buzzing in his shirt pocket
  and waking him up from his nap.  He took out his phone, studied the
  screen, then his head shot up, scanning the bus.  His eyes met the guy
  who took a picture of them, and they both bursted into laughter.
  Apparently they new each other, and the text he sent to him said
  something like &#8220;I can see you sleeping&#8221;.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s currently my best bus story.  Hope you all have a great day
  today.</p>
