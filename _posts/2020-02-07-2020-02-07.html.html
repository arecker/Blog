<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  Happy Friday.  It&#8217;s been a long week, and I&#8217;m
  grateful I get to say that this morning.  I could use a Friday, and
  I&#8217;m looking forward to resting up this weekend.  I might even sleep in
  tomorrow - who knows.  My Saturday morning alarm has always been low
  priority, and something tells me that after this week, it doesn&#8217;t
  stand a chance tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I found a nice, juicy bug to work on
  all morning somewhere in our build pipeline.  It sounds annoying, but
  truth be told of all the work I might take in a week - collaborating
  on documents, writing instructions, setting up demonstrations,
  implementing new features - bug fixes are the most straight forward.
  There&#8217;s little interpretation that goes into the success criteria of a
  bug.  Chances are, you don&#8217;t have to run anything by anyone or set up
  a meeting to talk about it.  Your work is simply done when the bug is
  fixed, and there&#8217;s nothing more to talk about.  It&#8217;s like filling out
  a cross word puzzle - Relaxing, and unambiguously finish-able.</p>
<p>Lunch time rolled around, and we three <i>cloumigos</i> decided to go out
  together.  We walked together up the block to Tavernakaya, sat at a
  quiet table, and ordered a round of beers.  We chatted about work,
  commiserating about the usual things, then got to talking about home
  life, the weekend, and free time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m playing around with a kubernetes cluster at home,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m
  having a lot of fun with it.&#8221;  Alex shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how
  you go home and do that stuff, infrastructure is the last thing I feel
  like thinking about when I get home,&#8221; replied Alex.  He continued.
  &#8220;As much as I hate to be the guy who sits in front of the TV after
  work, I almost need to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereas I&#8217;m just a regular engineer, Alex is a group tech lead.  He&#8217;s
  responsible for weighing in on architectural discussions happening in
  other teams and keeping everyone in sync.  Chances are he has a lot
  more to think about at work than I do.</p>
<p>Rob nodded in agreement.  &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t want to think about any of
  that shit either,&#8221; he said gruffly.  Rob is a long time Zendesk
  engineer - the only one seated at that table for three that predates
  my time.  He&#8217;s coming up on five years.  &#8220;So Robbo, you&#8217;re coming up
  on five years,&#8221; Alex began.  &#8220;That means you&#8217;re taking a sabbatical
  soon, right?&#8221;  Rob nodded and smiled.  &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s still a thing,&#8221; he
  said knowingly.</p>
<p>We continued talking over a second round of drinks, then made the walk
  back to the office.  Rob paused outside for a cigarette.  Alex and I
  huddled around him to carry on talking.  The wind picked up, and Alex
  and I went inside.  &#8220;That&#8217;s the real reason why I could never pick up
  smoking,&#8221; Alex said to me.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not good at standing outside when
  it&#8217;s cold out.&#8221;  I laughed, and we took the elevator up and returned
  to work.</p>
<p>I worked the rest of the afternoon, then paused at four to make a
  grocery list for tonight.  Wanting to broaden my repertoire, I did a
  quick google search for basic pan sauces.  My go to has up until this
  point been apple cider vinegar, apple juice, and honey.  /Any alcohol
  can be used in a pan sauce,/ I read.  The inclusion of beer piqued my
  interest.  I shut my laptop and headed out into the cold to catch the
  bus home.</p>
<p>Coming home, I entered the house quietly.  It wasn&#8217;t until I opened
  our back door, causing our alarm system to chirp, that Ziggy could be
  heard running through the dining room to greet me at the door.  She
  yawned, curled up at my feet, and following close behind was Ollie.
  Marissa was in and out of a nap on the couch with the Office quietly
  playing on the TV.  I greeted her, then went upstairs to get Rodney.
  Rodney was sleeping deeply, and even for his high strung toddler
  energy, it took a couple of shakes to wake him.</p>
<p>Rodney and I hopped in the car and got to chatting about his day.  He
  had gone to Canine Sports Zone with momma, and he was really excited
  about what he ate for lunch.  &#8220;Rice <i>krappy</i>, juice, goldfish&#8230; but
  rice <i>krappy</i> first!&#8221; he proclaimed.  Rodney is a staunch believer
  that desert, in this case a rice crispy bar, should be enjoyed first.</p>
<p>We shopped, picking up pork chops, potatoes, and restocking on
  Marissa&#8217;s favorite blueberry muffins.  As we swung around the outside
  of the store, Rodney called my attention.  &#8220;Uh, I have to go potty,&#8221;
  he said.  I glanced at the time on my phone and decided we could
  afford the extra trip all the way in the back by the bakery to use the
  potty.  It was a false alarm.</p>
<p>Back at home, I cooked dinner, assembling my beer and stone ground
  mustard pan sauce.  The base of the idea was good, but fearing it
  would bitter, I used a little too much honey and reduced it too much.
  The final product came out looking like - well - honey.  As we sat
  around the table talking, I got up to make a cup of tea.  After Fong
  made me a cup of ginseng tea when I was sick, I ordered some from the
  internet.  It&#8217;s essentially a little bag of fragrant sticks, like
  cinnamon, only if it branched.  I cracked a few twigs into a mug,
  added a dab of honey, and filled it with hot water before rejoining my
  family at the table.  I took a sip, letting out a deeply satisfied
  sigh.  &#8220;Oh, this is a new thing,&#8221; I said pointing at my tea.</p>
<p>Marissa wanted to get a jump on a large painting she was working, so I
  offered to put Rodney to bed.  After walking through his bedtime
  routine and finishing up my Dutch lesson, I crashed on the couch,
  followed closely by Ziggy who joined be under the blanket.  Thursday
  nights are my lazy night, and I usually spend the entire night on the
  couch binging YouTube videos.  Last night, nestled under the blanket
  with Ziggy, I watched Stephane of the French Cooking academy braise a
  pork shoulder in milk.  The milk was supposed to curdle, he explained,
  which is why he passed it through a sieve before thickening it with
  chunks of bread.  I teased Marissa that I found our next dinner idea.
  She gagged at the mere thought of a piece of meat simmering in milk.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the evening watching recipe videos for making Nasi
  Goreng.  I&#8217;m keen on the idea, but I&#8217;ll proceed with caution, as every
  time I&#8217;ve embarked on making fried rice, it&#8217;s been a thorny path
  fraught with peril - and nearly destroying the bottom of my pan.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thankful the weekend is here.  Tomorrow is my niece&#8217;s birthday,
  and we&#8217;re driving down to Chicago to see everyone.  Rodney, catching
  wind that he&#8217;d be hanging out with his cousins, is ecstatic, but I
  worry he thinks that every time we see them means a day of
  water slides.  That&#8217;s the toddler brain for ya.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day.  Thanks for reading, and welcome to
  the weekend!</p>
