excerpt: skeleton crews, pbs canvassers, and new independence
---
<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope this Saturday finds you well, and you&#8217;re
  finding energy this weekend.  At the moment, Marissa is getting ready
  in the bathroom and Rodney is munching on some Peanut Butter Captain
  Crunch on the couch watching YouTube videos.  Ziggy waits patiently in
  her crate, as instructed by Marissa.  &#8220;Ziggy has no self control with
  peanut butter captain crunch - I don&#8217;t trust her,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling good today.  In a few minutes, we&#8217;ll hit the road for
  Chicago to celebrate cousin Alice&#8217;s birthday, but first, I&#8217;m going to
  knock out a journal entry while everyone is content.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s work day was nice.  Our entire team took the day off, with
  the exception of me, Fong, and Alex.  &#8220;We got the <i>skeleton crew</i>
  today,&#8221; I said as we gathered around for our morning stand-up.  Fong
  looked puzzled.  &#8220;That&#8217;s what they call a crew who is short on
  workers,&#8221; said Alex, shedding light on my jargon.  &#8220;It can also refer
  to when your team is short on people, <i>and</i> they spend the day dressed
  wearing matching skeleton costumes,&#8221; I joked, dancing like a skeleton
  to emphasize the terrible joke.</p>
<p>After clearing up the American jargon, we quietly worked on projects
  through the morning, and in the afternoon Alex broke out some Japanese
  whiskey he received as a gift.  We sat around his desk sipping on
  whiskey and chatting, and I remained by their desks through the
  afternoon without my computer, riding shotgun while Alex took me
  through a configuration library he was designing.  &#8220;I hope you all
  don&#8217;t mind me hanging out here,&#8221; I remarked.  &#8220;I think I&#8217;m sometimes a
  better listener without my computer to distract me, and I&#8217;d like to
  listen to what you&#8217;re working on.&#8221;</p>
<p>We concluded the work day with our end of the week meeting, enjoying a
  few more sips of whiskey while we chatted about work, home life, and
  what this year looks like for us.  Fong perked up, hearing I&#8217;d be
  temporarily living on Willie street for a week while our floors were
  refinished.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll be neighbors,&#8221; she said, taking out her phone and
  showing me her favorite spots on Google maps.  I informally agreed to
  beach outing with the dogs.</p>
<p>I jumped the bus home, where I found Marissa busily working on a
  painting in the basement.  I peeked my head into the resin tent and
  greeted her.  &#8220;What do you feel like for dinner?&#8221; I asked.  Marissa,
  stared blankly and shrugged her shoulders.  &#8220;Feel like going out?&#8221; I
  asked.  She nodded, and I happily ran upstairs to crash on the couch
  with Ziggy until dinner time.</p>
<p>Soon, Rodney joined me on the couch after waking up from a terrible
  dream.  He was in such a bad mood, he barely greeted me before
  nestling under his blanket on the couch, sheepishly asking me to put
  on water slide videos.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a better idea, dude,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;Have
  you ever seen a <i>roller coaster</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Roollerrr&#8230; coaster&#8230;?</i>, repeated Rodney.  &#8220;Dude, they&#8217;re awesome,&#8221;
  added Marissa joining us on the couch.  &#8220;It&#8217;s like a water slide
  without any water.&#8221;  I took a moment to appreciate how odd, but
  accurate of an explanation that was.  Could you imagine using those
  words to describe a <i>roller coaster</i> to someone who&#8217;s only seen water
  slides?</p>
<p>We spent the next forty minutes lounging around on the couch watching
  videos of roller coasters, eventually transitioning to skateboard
  videos.  As we lay there soaking up a precious, lazy Friday afternoon,
  there was a loud rap on the door.  Marissa looked at me and rolled her
  eyes.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll get it,&#8221; I said, groaning while emerging from a pile of
  blankets and snuggles.</p>
<p>On our porch waited a thin, pale younger kid bundled up in a winter
  jacket and gloves.  He was holding some pamphlets and a clipboard -
  the dark harbinger of a terribly awkward conversation.  &#8220;Good evening,
  how are you?&#8221; he asked while staring at me blankly.  &#8220;Do you have a
  moment to talk about the financial needs of PBS?&#8221;  I patiently
  listened to his pitch, waiting for an inlet to dismiss myself, but he
  was persistent and tenacious.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of it online later,&#8221; I
  said, waving my hand dismissively and reaching for the door knob.
  &#8220;Sir, I&#8217;m going to be honest with you, most people who say they will
  sign up online don&#8217;t follow through, and I&#8217;d really like to get you
  set up right now, tonight.&#8221;  Almost as if being conned by a slimy
  street magician with crafty sleight of hand, suddenly instead of
  holding my doorknob, I was holding his clipboard, turned to a blank
  page with a sign up form.  &#8220;I&#8217;m different.  I promise you,&#8221; I stated,
  gently shoving the clipboard back into his arms.  &#8220;I follow through
  with things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, but you already admitted you find PBS programming valuable,&#8221; he
  interrupted me.  Suddenly his tone changed, like I was about to be
  fingered for a murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise you.  I&#8217;ll do it online,&#8221; I repeated, wrapping my fingers
  more tightly around our doorknob.  The canvaser surrendered, nodding
  and trudging away from our door.  Spoiler alert - I didn&#8217;t sign up
  online.  Yes, at some point in the awful conversation, I admitted to
  <i>finding PBS programming valuable</i>.  But it&#8217;s 2020.  You can&#8217;t bully
  people during dinner time on their front porch.  That&#8217;s the kind of
  psychological warfare that&#8217;s only socially acceptable on the Internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;OK, I&#8217;m getting hungry, can we get on with this night?&#8221; I said
  clapping my hands, trying to get everyone off the couch.  Marissa
  frowned at me, and I immediately realized my error.  &#8220;Sorry,&#8221; I
  admitted in a softer tone.  &#8220;That PBS guy really put me in a bad
  mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>We jumped in the car and found a table at Glass Nickel.  I enjoyed a
  beer and a toasted BLT while Marissa and Rodney polished off a veggie
  pizza.  At some point, Rodney flagged down the waitress to tell her
  about all the animals he saw in the zoo, and she was a good sport
  about it, thanking him for letting her in on the day&#8217;s events.  We
  paid the check and headed home.  The beer and the sandwich put me in a
  good mood, and the pushy PBS canvasser that put me in a bad mood was a
  distant memory.</p>
<p>While putting Rodney to bed, I was suddenly inspired to try something
  new.  &#8220;Hey Rod,&#8221; I said.  His head perked up.  &#8220;You&#8217;re wearing a
  diaper, would you mind getting your pajamas on then brushing your
  teeth?  I&#8217;m going to start a load of wash.&#8221;  Rodney nodded, and there
  was a new sparkle of independence in his eyes.  I trudged downstairs
  with a basket of laundry.  Marissa spied on Rodney from around the
  corner in her gallery.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did really well,&#8221; said Marissa as I was coming back up the stairs.
  &#8220;You should have seen how carefully he rinsed his toothbrush.&#8221;  Rodney
  was in his room seated at the foot of his bed.  He looked like a tiny
  Mr. Rodgers, carefully stepping into each of his slippers in
  preparation for bed time.  I read him a story, then tucked him in for
  the night.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Saturday.  If you see Alice, wish her a
  Happy Birthday.  And if you see someone with a PBS clipboard at your
  door this evening, do yourself a favor and wait until they walk away.</p>
