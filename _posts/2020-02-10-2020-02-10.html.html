<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  That was definitely one of the busier
  weekends I&#8217;ve had.  This morning, as I was showering, getting dressed,
  and sleepily passing through my morning routine like a lifeless ghost,
  I mentally sang that song from the movie <i>Sing</i> - you know the one
  that the gorilla kid sings?  <i>I&#8217;m</i> <i>still standing - yeah, yeah, yeah.
  I&#8217;m still standing - yeah, yeah,/ /yeah&#8230;</i> And while being at my
  breaking point on a Monday morning doesn&#8217;t sound very promising, the
  end is in sight.  Most of yesterday was spent preparing Marissa&#8217;s
  three giant paintings for their trip to New York.  I&#8217;m working from
  home this morning so I can help get it in the truck.</p>
<p>We got some good relaxing in yesterday morning, at least.  The family
  slept in, eating eggs on the couch and watching YouTube videos while I
  finished writing.  We got changed and headed out for the day, starting
  things off with a Portillo&#8217;s lunch.  We grabbed a spot in the back and
  sank into the comfy booths, eager to dig into Italian beef, chicken
  tenders, fries, and a chocolate shake.  As we finished eating, we got
  a little more serious about planning the day before departing for
  Hy-Vee to pick up groceries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it when we all pick up groceries together,&#8221; I said walking
  through the Hy-Vee parking lot.  &#8220;We always have better snacks in the
  house when Momma comes with.&#8221;  Rodney reach out and grabbed my hand as
  we crossed the road in front of Hy-Vee, stretching his other arm out
  to the sky, making a <i>woosh</i> sound.  As in our custom, he was
  initiating <i>spider shoot webs</i>, where I pick him up and let him swing
  all the way up to the door.</p>
<p>We picked up groceries, then headed home.  Marissa put Rodney down for
  a nap, then one by one, we moved the large paintings to our front
  porch so Marissa could get some pictures.  For such a simple task as
  standing outside and taking pictures of Marissa in front of a
  painting, I had difficulty hiding my grumpiness about the whole thing.
  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it is,&#8221; I&#8217;d say to her later trying to suss out my
  frustration with Marissa in the dining room over some tea.  &#8220;Maybe I
  just feel silly standing out in the snow taking a photo, or maybe I
  don&#8217;t like having to march back to you in between takes to show you
  the photo.&#8221;</p>
<p>We moved the paintings back inside, and Marissa continued touching up
  the sides with white paint while I moved outside to shovel some snow.
  Short on time before I had to start dinner, I only managed to finish
  our back porch and half the driveway.  The neighbors were also out,
  and even though I was in a bad mood, I still offered up my usual small
  talk about shoveling snow.  &#8220;Happy February, huh?  Oh NOW we get snow,
  right?  Great workout!  Hey, I think you missed a spot!&#8221;</p>
<p>I headed back into the kitchen, kicking the wet snow off my boots and
  exchanging my coat for a cooking apron.  For dinner, I was making beef
  goulash.  I cubed some chuck roast and browned it in a pan, later
  adding onions.  I toasted caraway seeds, paprika, and cayenne papper,
  de-glazing the pan with chicken stock and moving everything to my
  dutch oven to let the mixture simmer.  The stock had already taken on
  the color of chocolate, and the hot smoky spices lingered in the air.
  I would let it simmer for an hour while Rodney, awake from his nap,
  helped pull some marjoram leaves apart.  Rodney had just woken up from
  his long nap, and at first when he marched into the kitchen, he had
  made up his mind about cooking himself a box of paw patrol mac &#8216;n
  cheese, but he eventually came around to what I was making for
  dinner.  I served the goulash on some buttered shell pasta with a
  dollop of sour cream.  &#8220;I&#8217;m relieved that this tastes good,&#8221; said
  Marissa at the table.  &#8220;It smelled so strong in the kitchen, I was
  starting to get worried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That must have been the spices I was toasting,&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;It
  started to smoke, and I&#8217;m not sure if that was supposed to happen, so
  I killed the heat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Putting Rodney to bed, we decided to break out his new bilingual Dutch
  childnren&#8217;s book, <i>Jojo&#8217;s Speeldag</i>.  It&#8217;s a book about an elephant
  who, rather than eating his dinner, wanders away and screws around in
  the forest.  Of course a Dutch book would be about not cleaning your
  plate, right?  Rodney was intrigued.  I alternated between English on
  every page, mixing in some fun new words like <i>snuffel</i> (an elephant&#8217;s
  trunk) and <i>fruitbomen</i> (fruit tree).  &#8220;How did he like the book?&#8221;
  asked Marissa.  &#8220;He didn&#8217;t even notice,&#8221; I laughed.  &#8220;We could have
  been reading to him in another language all this time for all he
  knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, I rejoined Marissa in the dining room to
  finish packing the paintings.  It was a challenge.  We wrapped the
  paintings in bubble wrap, then upon realizing they wouldn&#8217;t fit in the
  boxes, unwrapped them.  We cleared the table, flipping the paintings
  over the top and shoving the box from the other end like a sheath.
  Marissa repaired the box, which had ripped at the edges from the
  friction, and meanwhile I stole away to move a filing cabinet into the
  basement.  Finally, we turned the boxes on each corner, wrapping the
  outsides with seran wrap and cushioning the corners before finally
  bundling them all together as a towering mass of cardboard and
  plastic - the very same towering mass that looms over our dining room
  computer while I write this morning.  I opened a beer, and we
  retreated upstairs, collapsing in our bedroom chairs.</p>
<p>We congratulated ourselves for the massive effort, then planned out
  the rest of the week before watching a movie on the couch.  I broke
  out some chips and salsa, and Marissa stuck to the usual pregnancy
  craving inspired evening snack.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;m hanging around the house so we can together lift the
  massive beast in the truck, which will carry the paintings to their
  new home in New York.  The paintings are quite beautiful.  I did my
  best yesterday to find time between the shlepping, photos, taping,
  hoisting, and lifting to just stop and look at them.  Once the
  paintings are in the truck, we&#8217;re going to celebrate with a pizza
  lunch.  I think I might even get a beer.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day today.</p>
