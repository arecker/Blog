<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Well, good morning everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re all feeling good today.  I
  find it hard to believe it&#8217;s only Wednesday.  I feel like I&#8217;ve already
  put in a week&#8217;s worth of work, and I&#8217;m craving a weekend right about
  now.  I&#8217;m fantasizing about the next time I can fall asleep on the
  couch, or at the very least hide under a blanket and watch TV, but I
  think I still have enough resolve to soldier on.  I&#8217;m feeling grateful
  that this will be one of those weeks that peaks with Thursday night&#8217;s
  kids code, followed by a well-earned lazy night where I do all of the
  above.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a quiet day.  I spent most of the day writing code and
  listening to Kesha&#8217;s new album.  For lunch, I snuck out to Starbucks
  and sat at the table attached to the bar, gobbling down a chicken and
  bacon panini and washing it down with an iced tea.  My phone buzzed.
  &#8220;Rodney is the happiest he has ever been right now,&#8221; Marissa said in a
  slack message.  A photo appeared, loading on the screen, showing
  Rodney flashing a grin and a thumbs-up siting at the table in front of
  a hot bowl of Paw Patrol Mac n Cheese - a new obsession that has
  overtaken his pallet.  It&#8217;s pretty remarkable how quickly a kid can
  get hooked on mac &#8216;n cheese.  I bought those boxes with Rodney the day
  before.  He approached the mac &#8216;n cheese wall ceremoniously, and stood
  for a minute deliberating between the Chase box and the Marshall box.
  When we got home, as I was cooking dinner, he ran up to me and
  pleaded, &#8220;Dada, um&#8230; one box of pAH-trol mac-cheese.  Please please
  please?&#8221;  I laughed.  &#8220;Mac &#8216;n cheese isn&#8217;t a snack, dude.  It&#8217;s a
  meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>I too was feeling happy, hiding at the end of the Starbucks bar
  polishing off a bag of chips.  Maybe not as happy as Rodney, but it
  was my own much needed solace before returning back to work.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was pretty kicked back as well.  I had a
  one-on-one with my manager.  We bundled up and went for a walk around
  the square, completing two laps while we chatted about our team and
  our work.  Before heading inside, we stopped by Walgreen&#8217;s to pick up
  some gum for our team&#8217;s communal gum &amp; mint stash.</p>
<p>Taking the bus home and entering the house, I got to rinsing two cups
  of rice before greeting Marissa, who was coming out of an afternoon
  nap on the couch.  &#8220;Rodney is pretty tired, but I think he&#8217;ll feel
  like going out,&#8221; she said before I quietly traversed the stairs to his
  bedroom.  Rodney&#8217;s head shot up in bed.  &#8220;Hello Dada!&#8221; he said from
  underneath his covers.</p>
<p>Together we drove to Hy-Vee, Rodney filling the car with stories about
  his day.  For making some poop progress, he earned a spiky, light up
  bouncy ball.  He was also still reeling from his Mac &#8216;n Cheese lunch.
  &#8220;You should have seen him in the kitchen,&#8221; recounted Marissa later.
  &#8220;He was standing on a chair stirring in the butter into the noodles,
  and he was humming the Paw Patrol theme song to himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>We shopped around Hy-Vee, picking up chicken thighs, tomatoes,
  garlic, ginger, and a pack of pita bread.  I planned on making chicken
  tikka masala, and anticipated the last few ingredients turning into a
  bit of a treasure hunt.  Rodney and I perused the organic aisle.  A
  Hy-Vee employee turned to us, asking &#8220;Can I help you find anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually yeah,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;Two things - coconut milk and ghee.&#8221;  The
  employee took on a panicked look, darting into the back aisle toward
  the milk while Rodney and I followed.  She directed us to a carton of
  coconut milk - technically correct, but I was looking for a small
  can.  I&#8217;m not sure what I would do with an entire carton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfect,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;Now what was that last thing?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; <i>ghee</i>?  Clarified butter,&#8221; I hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; she questioned.  I nervously shifted on the balls of my
  feet.  &#8220;You know what,&#8221; I added.  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to skip it.&#8221;  The
  employee looked at me in horror.  &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; she questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah totally,&#8221; I assured her.  &#8220;You can make it at home, it&#8217;s just an
  extra step.&#8221;  From the corner of my eye, I saw another shopper wheel
  her cart closer, poised to interject.  &#8220;It&#8217;s also known as ghee!&#8221; she
  interrupted.  &#8220;It&#8217;s shelf stable.  I bet it&#8217;s by the Indian food.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, I can go without it,&#8221; I said, now addressing what felt like a
  gaggle of unwelcome influences in me and Rodney&#8217;s shopping trip.
  &#8220;It&#8217;s OK, I have a back-up plan.  I&#8217;m calling off the search.&#8221;  And
  it&#8217;s a good think I did.  On the way to the checkout aisle, Hy-Vee did
  indeed carry ghee on the shelf - a whopping ten dollars for a jar the
  size of, well, the can of coconut milk I was hoping to buy before I
  settled on the family sized carton.  &#8220;No way dude,&#8221; I said to Rodney
  following close behind me.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s just melt some stinking butter
  instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back at home, I set Rodney up at the table with a snack and got to
  cooking.  I tossed the chicken in spices, then melted some butter in
  the bottom of my dutch oven and skimmed the fat onto a paper towel.  I
  seared the chicken slices in the thighs.  They turned crispy,
  releasing a fragrant bouquet of smells into the air.  I moved the
  chicken aside, adding onions, garlic, ginger, and tomatoes, then
  simmered it gently with chicken stock and coconut milk.  Everything
  turned out great - except of course for the rice.  As is tradition in
  my kitchen, putting way too much focus on the meal, I botched the
  rice.  &#8220;So I know the rice is bad,&#8221; I said, offering a taste to
  Marissa in the living room.  &#8220;But I just need a second opinion to
  confirm that it is edible.&#8221;  With a mouthful of slimy, undercooked
  white rice, Marissa gave a thumbs up before trotting up the stairs.
  At least we had plenty of warm pita bread to make up for it.</p>
<p>We sat at the table for a while, digesting our food and watching
  Rodney&#8217;s antics, before cleaning up and watching a few trick shot
  YouTube videos on the couch.  Marissa joined us, then, initiation
  clean-up time, I switch to some loud music.  We all got up off the
  couch and started to pick up toys.  Rodney was flipping his toy cars
  behind his head, aiming to get them in the box in his play corner -
  his own brand of clean-up themed <i>trick shots</i>.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s GOOOOOOO&#8221; he
  exclaimed, running in circles after each small success.</p>
<p>We put him to bed, and after knocking out Dutch and exercise, I did my
  best to overcome Indian food induced sleepiness while cleaning up the
  kitchen.  &#8220;These spices are brutal,&#8221; I said to Marissa while clearing
  the stove top.  &#8220;I just want to sleep right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember we used to eat at that Indian restaurant on Sundays and just
  nap the whole day?&#8221; added Marissa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;We would all wake up at like 7 PM, and not know
  what to do with ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rinsed my Dutch oven in the sink, forming a pool of shimmering
  orange liquid around the train.  I was so captivated by the color of
  the tumeric reflecting off our white cast iron sink beneath the bright
  kitchen light that I stopped to take a picture.  It&#8217;s a shame these
  spices make you so sleepy, because they look absolutely fantastic and
  they smell amazing.</p>
<p>I fixed myself a coconut milk and tequila smoothie, then joined
  Marissa at the project board for a quick sync up.  The plan is to
  finish our tasks by Friday, then we&#8217;ll take the whole weekend to paint
  the basement.  And we&#8217;re doing great - right on track to hit our goal
  for this week.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day today.  Thanks for reading.</p>
