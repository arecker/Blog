<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Hello, everyone!  Happy Saturday.  I hope you&#8217;re taking things slow
  today, and finding plenty of time to lazily soak up a morning while
  staying warm inside.  Currently, we&#8217;re about as relaxed as you can be.
  I woke up around ten, hearing Rodney call out in the hallway.
  <i>Helloooo?  Anyone there?</i>.  The two of us, followed by the dogs, made
  our way downstairs.  I set Rodney up by his chalkboard with a cold cup
  of apple juice, brewed some coffee, and prepared a Dutch baby in the
  kitchen while putting things away.  Later joined by Marissa, we
  enjoyed a late breakfast with some cut up fruit.  Currently, Marissa
  is painting in her studio, Rodney is playing with playdough in the
  living room, and I&#8217;m upstairs writing with a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a great day as well.  I worked through the morning, and
  for lunch we went out to eat with the Security team, sitting at a long
  table in the back of Tavernakaya.  Seated across the table from me was
  Forest, a new hire and recent transplant from the bay area.  I had a
  great time getting to know Forest.  He&#8217;s a recent football fan, has
  plenty of hobbies and opinions, and he likes spicy food.  Talk about
  kindred spirits, right?</p>
<p>I worked through the afternoon before jumping on a bus.  At home, the
  house was empty.  I even trudged up the stairs into our bedroom
  talking to the dogs, only to find that they were missing as well.
  After cluelessly spinning in our bedroom like Jon Travolta in <i>Pulp
  Fiction</i>, I remembered that the dogs had a vet appointment.  I decided
  to make the most of the alone time and crash on the couch, enjoying
  some YouTube.  Extended the length of the couch polishing off a
  handful of cheese curds, I enjoyed a compilation video of the 100 best
  catches of the 2019 NFL season, which had a decent Bears
  representation.  It&#8217;s no surprise - we had a pass heavy offense this
  past season, and between Robinson and Gabriel, there were lots of
  great snags in the backfield to choose from.</p>
<p>Marissa and the rest of the family pulled up in the driveway.  The
  door cracked open, and the dogs ran into the living room followed by
  Rodney.  &#8220;Ziggy has pinkeye,&#8221; announced Marissa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, is it contagious?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually the vet, didn&#8217;t give me a straight answer.  I asked if it
  was contagious, and she was like, &#8216;you&#8217;d have to really <i>get in there</i>
  to catch it from her&#8217;,&#8221; she said.  We grimaced at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the vet know how much&#8230; physical contact we share with her?
  She should have probably gone into the specifics,&#8221; I laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Marissa said, nodding.  This morning I woke up with her face
  literally pressed against my face.  I think our eyeballs were even
  touching.&#8221;</p>
<p>We crashed on the couch as a family for a bit, then finally packed the
  dogs up and jumped in the car, headed for the bowling alley.  The
  bowling alley was packed.  &#8220;You probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to get a
  lane until like 8:30,&#8221; said the young kid behind the counter,
  shrugging.  A bit disappointed, we jumped back in the car to discuss a
  back-up plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to figure out why I&#8217;m so frustrated,&#8221; I said as we made
  are way over to the Ale Asylum to play pinball.  &#8220;I think it&#8217;s because
  I&#8217;ve never been turned away from a bowling alley.  Who expects a
  bowling alley to be busy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;I mean it&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s day.  Why is
  everyone out bowling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excactly!  On Valentine&#8217;s day, no less.  What is everyone doing
  bowling?&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;It&#8217;s like if you went into a 7/11 to grab a
  slushy, and there was a line out the door and you had to go somewhere
  else.&#8221;  Ironically, Rodney was probably handling the change of plans
  best.  After we explained to him that bowling was going to pan out, he
  jumped into his car seat and nodded off.</p>
<p>We found a table in the back of the Ale Asylum and ordered food.  We
  chatted while sipping on beer, diet coke, and lemonade.  Rodney
  started to get bored, waiting patiently in his chair.  &#8220;Want to play
  with my phone, dude?&#8221; said Marissa, opening the Solitaire app and
  sliding it over to him.  Rodney eagerly started to poke and jab the
  screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a nice boy,&#8221; I said, watching him patiently occupy himself.  &#8220;I
  think he&#8217;s almost ready to have a gameboy - that might be a fun new
  toy to get when he gets a new brother.  He&#8217;s a nice boy, and he
  deserves something fun and special to bring along on outings.&#8221;
  Although I never had a gameboy, I have lots of fond memories of
  escaping into the basement after a busy day of school and mentally
  recharging with some video games.  &#8220;He likes to sit and focus on
  things,&#8221; I added.  &#8220;I think he would really take to video games.&#8221;</p>
<p>We ate our food, then ordered desert - a chocolate covered Belgian
  waffle with a chaser of porter.  I sipped the beer while the plate
  practically disappeared before my eyes.  By the time the waitress
  returned, all that remained on the plate was a chocolate smudge and a
  single raspberry.  Rodney and I left the table to go make change,
  meeting Marissa by the pinball machines for a quick game before
  returning home and putting Rodney to bed.</p>
<p>Marissa spent the rest of the evening painting upstairs while I put
  things away in the kitchen and cleaned the fridge.  We had a tube of
  pineapple that just barely didn&#8217;t fit in a smaller tupperware
  container.  I sliced off a chunk and diced it, throwing the pieces
  into a bowl.  Soon, a bag of chopped kale and some spare klemintines
  joined the fruit, as I began mixing an impromptu fruit &amp; kale salad,
  adding sunflower seeds and the last of a bottle of balsamic dressing.
  As a finishing touch, I fried a piece of stale pita bread in butter
  and olive oil and cut it into a heart.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a Valentine&#8217;s day
  salad,&#8221; I said, handing the bowl to Marissa in her studio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did this all start with you trying to move the pineapple to a smaller
  container?&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much it,&#8221; I laughed.  She knows me well.  In
  between assembling the kale salad, I also made a batch of white rice.
  After ten minutes of simmering the carefully measured ratio of rice
  and lightly salted water, a wave of panic washed over me.  Lifting the
  lid, I could see there was still about an inch of water in the pan,
  and tasting the rice, it was crunchy and far from finished.</p>
<p>/I&#8217;m just going to have to wing it,/ I thought to myself, shutting off
  the oven timer and cranking the heat.  I let the rice boil for ten
  more minutes, occasionally lifting the lid to sample it on a fork.
  &#8220;That&#8217;s just you cooking,&#8221; I said aloud to myself, repeating a
  recurring catch phrase of Chef John.</p>
<p>When the rice was tender, I swiftly dumped it onto a silpat and
  fluffed it with a fork, releasing plumes of steam into the air.  I
  added a splash of mirin, tossing and fluffing the rice.  The rice was
  sticky, but fluffy, flavorful, and still held together.  Despite the
  exact timing going off the rails, this batch was a success.  Chef John
  is right.  Sometimes you have to abandon prescriptive instructions and
  just go by taste, sound, and the way things look.  <i>That&#8217;s just you
  cooking</i>.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful Saturday today.  Thanks for reading.</p>
