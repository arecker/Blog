excerpt: morning drama, hangriness, paint, and errands

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, and happy Monday to you!  This morning, we&#8217;re still on
  weekend journaling hours as I have the day of for President&#8217;s day.  I
  hope you do as well, and that you&#8217;re getting the most out of the extra
  weekend day.</p>
<p>I woke up with the dogs and Rodney around 9, and they day was already
  filled with drama - lemme tell you.  Rodney was complaining about a
  cut on his finger.  Yesterday while shopping at Hy-Vee, he
  face-planted in the parking lot beside our car.  Baby giraffe went
  rolling out of his arms, and he landed square on his chocolate egg,
  crumpling the plastic beneath his braced hands.  If I spend too much
  time thinking about the face he made seeing that his chocolate egg was
  crushed, I might start crying myself, but he earned himself a few
  nasty battle scars on his fingers that were sore this morning.</p>
<p>I ushered him out of his room and sat him in the bathroom while I
  grabbed a bandaid and a tube of Neosporin.  I dabbed a drop on his
  cut, pushed it in a circle, then wrapped it in a bandage.  Rodney was
  so fascinated with the procedure that he forgot what was upsetting
  him.  With the dogs following closely behind, we changed into some
  sweats and made our way into the kitchen.  Rodney and I used the last
  two eggs in our fridge to make an omelet, dividing it in half and
  plating it up with some Cheerios so he could ease into the morning
  with some Bob the Builder.</p>
<p>But the drama wasn&#8217;t yet finished.  A few minutes into washing dishes
  and preparing morning coffee, I heard a shriek from the living room,
  finding his plate flipped over on the floor and Ziggy hungrily
  gobbling eggs off the floor.  I scolded her and put her in the bedroom
  crate.  &#8220;Did Ziggy get all your eggs, dude?&#8221; I asked.  Rodney nodded
  with tears in his eyes.  &#8220;Here, lemme get you a bowl of peanut butter
  cereal,&#8221; I said, heading back into the kitchen.  So now with both
  punishment and replacement cereal dispensed, we&#8217;re back to an easy
  morning.</p>
<p><i>Sip</i>.  Yesterday was a pretty good day.  We left the house for church
  later than usual.  Something about our family timing got goofed, and
  we didn&#8217;t leave the driveway until 11:03.  &#8220;What are you talking
  about,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;We&#8217;re not <i>usually</i> late for church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes we are,&#8221; I contested.  &#8220;We&#8217;re not usually <i>this</i> late, but we
  rarely get their on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t late last week,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;When we got there, we had
  to drop Rodney off and use the bathroom, but we were still in the
  building before the service started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh I see,&#8221; I jeered.  &#8220;I think we just have differing terms.  I&#8217;d
  consider us late if we don&#8217;t have our butts in a pew by the time the
  first song starts.&#8221;</p>
<p>After church let out, we picked up Rodney from Sunday School.  He was
  busily coloring and cleaning the giant chalkboard wall around the
  corner from the toys.  Lately, Rodney has become fascinated with
  chalkboards - and only half of it actually has to do with the drawing.
  At home, he&#8217;s come up with an elaborate system for wiping the board
  clean, stuffing the baby wipe into a plastic cup, then emptying the
  plastic cup into the garbage can when it&#8217;s full.  At church, they had
  a wet sponge set aside to clean the board, and Rodney had fully
  commandeered it for his amusement.  &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s a smart system, dude,&#8221;
  said Marissa.  &#8220;We should switch to a sponge at home, Miss Maddie
  knows her stuff huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before leaving, we started chatting with the parents of Owen, one of
  Rodney&#8217;s Sunday school cohorts.  We recognized them from stage.
  Natalie played the piano and sang in worship, and her husband played
  the guitar.  Though this particular Sunday, he opened the offertory
  with a cello solo, which was undeniably cool.</p>
<p>We left church, beginning our Sunday afternoon errands, first stopping
  at Home Depot.  Even though I agreed to knock out Home Depot before
  lunch, my fickle stomach starting to grumble in the parking lot on the
  way in.  &#8220;I think I underestimated how hungry I was,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;We&#8217;re
  officially in the <i>danger zone</i>.&#8221;  I was, of course, talking about my
  own susceptibility to <i>hangriness</i>.  When you are so hungry that you
  teeter on the edge of a childish outburst in public.  <i>Hangry</i>.
  &#8220;We&#8217;ll go fast,&#8221; said Marissa, nodding dutifully.</p>
<p>Soon enough, we were out of Home Depot, and seated at Portillo&#8217;s
  polishing off fries, hot dogs, and splitting a chocolate shake that,
  in the lunch rush pandemonium, had accidentally been supersized for
  us, free of charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we get to go to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,&#8221; I smiled.  &#8220;It&#8217;s the fun
  errand.&#8221;  I love Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.  The official plan was to pick up
  a new nonstick pan, but secretly Marissa and I had a mutual
  understanding that we were about to <i>make it rain</i>.  It&#8217;s almost
  impossible for us to go into that store without seeing other things we
  like.  Along with the new 14 inch nonstick skillet, our haul included
  a stainless steel stock pot, a fish spatula, a step stool for Rodney,
  a cushy kitchen dish washing mat, and a spontaneous &#8216;get well soon&#8217;
  dog toy for Ziggy, at home still in the throws of puppy pinkeye.</p>
<p>Back at home, Marissa donned a white jumpsuit and descended into the
  basement to paint the ceiling, leaving me to set up my new kitchen
  toys.  After putting everything away, I brewed a pot of coffee and
  washed some dishes, enjoying the new supportive dish washing mat.</p>
<p>Later, I got Rodney up from his nap and went to Hy-Vee, leaving
  Marissa to continue wrestling with white paint in the basement.  To
  kick the tires on our new nonstick pan, I chose to revisit potato and
  kale hash.  &#8220;If this works out, this will suddenly become a very easy
  one pot meal,&#8221; I bragged while putting the groceries away.  And it was
  easy.  The new pan made browning the crispy potatoes so easy, it was
  embarrassing.  With one hand, I tossed the potatoes in sizzling bacon
  fat, and with the other hand, I played catch with Rodney in the
  kitchen until dinner was ready.</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, I joined Marissa in the basement to check
  on her work.  She had painted almost the entire exposed ceiling and
  walls a pure white.  The basement felt brighter, and paradoxically,
  bigger.  &#8220;I have the sudden urge to sit down here and play video
  games,&#8221; I laughed.  Marissa waggled her eye brows.  &#8220;We should get a
  playstation,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.  Hope you have a great day today.  Happy
  President&#8217;s day - make sure you take it easy today, it&#8217;s what George
  Washington would have wanted.</p>
