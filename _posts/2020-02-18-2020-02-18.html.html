<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Tuesday.  I hope that you&#8217;re feeling
  good today and ready to return to work.  I probably relaxed a little
  too hard this weekend.  Whether the extra weekend snacking, the
  junk food, or the sleeping in is to blame, I&#8217;m having a hard time
  waking up this morning.  But I&#8217;ll get there.  The promise of more
  coffee keeps me interested in getting out the door and on my way to
  work, and in the end, that&#8217;s all I need as motivation.</p>
<p>Speaking of relaxation, yesterday was a great day.  In the late
  morning, Marissa surprised me by taking Rodney to Home Depot - leaving
  me to hang out in the dining room and continue working on code.  This
  week as my IT task, I&#8217;m bolting on a photo manager to our internal
  website where you can quickly upload photos to be added into the
  random desktop wallpapers and screensavers that appear throughout the
  house.  Using random, regularly rotating photos as the computer
  wallpaper started out as a small, spontaneous thing that I slapped
  together one day on our family computer, but it&#8217;s turned into a real
  source of joy for me, and I&#8217;m happy to invest more time into it.  It
  also felt great to get a long coding session in.  It felt good to be
  alone with my thoughts and clean things up on the homefront.</p>
<p>Marissa and Rodney returned, and while they were out, they picked me
  up an iced coffee from mocha.  Rodney sat at the table with his mango
  smoothie.  For lunch, I made Marissa and Rodney a double batch of Paw
  Patrol Mac n Cheese.  As this is Rodney&#8217;s favorite meal, there was a
  lot of pressure on me to make it right.  I was under strict orders to
  skip adding the milk, and not add anything extra like meat or pickles.
  In the end, my batch was acceptable, and I showed that I could be
  relied upon for a straight up, no frills bowl of Paw Patrol Mac n
  Cheese.  I heated up a bowl of ramen and joined them at the table for
  lunch.  We toasted our Mocha beverages.</p>
<p>After lunch, I put Rodney down for a nap.  I was tempted to return to
  coding, but as the snow was starting to pickup, I thought it was a
  good time to do some shoveling.  I cleared the deck, porch, and the
  driveway while the puppies frolicked outside.  Despite the
  accumulating snow, it was a warmer day.  I barely felt the need to
  wear a coat.  The snow was also damp and fluffy, and just about
  perfect for making snowballs.  While shoveling, I got distracted by
  trying to get a snowball onto East Washington from our back deck.</p>
<p>After the sun went down, Marissa slowly woke up from her nap on the
  couch, and I got Rodney out of his room.  The plan was to spend the
  evening bowling at our usual place.  While Marissa got put the dogs
  away and locked up the house, Rodney and I headed outside to the back
  porch to play in the snow.  Rodney ran around the backyard while I
  lobbed snowballs at him.  Then he started to point to things he wanted
  me to hit.  I threw a snowball at the brick side of our house, his
  bedroom window, his swingset, and the back door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dude, let me see if I can hit the garage window from here,&#8221; I said,
  packing another snowball together.  Rodney stood by in anticipation as
  I cocked my arm and launched the snowball.  It struck squarely on the
  window pane, shattering the glass.  A few shards of glass tumbled to
  the ground.  Rodney&#8217;s mouth dropped.  &#8221;<i>Uh Oh</i>&#8221;, he said.  Even though
  it would have been fun to build the moment up and see if Rodney would
  snitch on me, I instead chose to alleviate his conscience.  &#8220;It&#8217;s OK
  dude,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;That window was already broken.  Here - let&#8217;s get the
  pieces so the dogs don&#8217;t step on &#8216;em.&#8221;  Marissa came outside as we
  were picking up the mess.  No explanation was needed.</p>
<p>We jumped in the car, drove to Dream Lanes, and found our way to an
  empty lane.  While renting a lane and ordering food, we had an
  important moment of clarity about our usual bowling alley.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t
  have any working lanes open,&#8221; said the guy at the counter.  &#8220;The
  bumpers don&#8217;t work, they&#8217;ll either have to be all up or all down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it weird how we always get stuck with a broken lane?&#8221; I asked
  Marissa after the guy walked back to the counter.  &#8220;It felt like we
  walked by several good, empty lanes.  And while we&#8217;re at it, why does
  it always feel like 75% of this place is booked out for leagues every
  night?&#8221;  We started to notice a pattern.  Casual, non-league bowlers
  like us were always assigned lanes 1 through 6.  At the other end of
  the alley, was a group of much more serious players.  &#8220;They don&#8217;t even
  look like they&#8217;re having fun,&#8221; commented Marissa.</p>
<p>Our food arrived.  They got our order wrong, and they brought us the
  wrong sized pizza.  Instead of asking them to remake it, I instead
  went back to the counter to order a side of pig wings.  &#8220;The pig wings
  are $10 now,&#8221; said the kid at the counter.  &#8220;That&#8217;s ridiculous,&#8221; I
  replied.  &#8220;Yeah, I know,&#8221; said the kid at the counter.  &#8220;I wish I
  could give you a discount, but I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dream Lanes is black listed,&#8221; I announced, returning from food
  counter and holding a resolute finger in the air.  <i>Black listing</i> is
  a very serious matter for our family.  It happens when enough goes
  wrong all at once to make us so angry at a restaurant or establishment
  that we can never go back.  By the end of the night, we even had
  Rodney yelling <i>Ya BLACKLISTED</i>.  So to sum up, the Recker family is
  now officially interviewing for a new bowling alley.</p>
<p>Today should be a good day.  This is the final week before we
  temporarily move out of our house.  While we&#8217;re right on track
  productivity wise, this is an important week to stay the course.  Our
  house will start to feel really empty as we approach Sunday.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.  Hope you have a wonderful day.</p>
