<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re feeling good today.  We have a
  lot to be thankful for today.  The only thing standing between us and
  a well-deserved weekend is just this measly Thursday.  I don&#8217;t know
  about you, but I eat Thursdays for breakfast.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a bit of gritty motivation to get you started.  I slept
  pretty well, despite waking up at 4 AM.  I don&#8217;t know if I woke up
  first, or if Rodney woke me up somehow, but we had a funny little
  interaction a few hours ago where I sat down in his bed and gave him a
  sip of water.  He emptied the plastic cup, and his head hit the pillow
  immediately after.  I could have sworn he was already snoring by the
  time I cracked his door and said <i>g&#8217;night, dude</i>.  I too, of course,
  fell right back asleep until my usual wake up time.</p>
<p>At the moment, everyone who is supposed to be sleeping is contentedly
  sleeping.  I&#8217;m seated comfortably at my desk, wearing my favorite
  hoodie and a worn pair of blue jeans.  My desktop wallpaper is the
  ceiling of an outdoor tent packed with hanging paper Asian lamps - a
  picture we took last time we were in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  Working from home, I warmed up for
  the day with a cup of coffee, setting Rodney up on the couch with a
  cereal bar, some juice, and some Paw Patrol re-runs.  I attended our
  morning stand-up from the dining room table.  Rodney, curious as to
  what I was up to, wandered over and joined me at the table, craning
  his neck into my webcam before the meeting ended and we all bid
  farewell.  My morning rolled into a second meeting with my tech lead,
  where we filled out a google doc&#8217;s worth of questions dredged from my
  research that week.  He demonstrated admirable patience, taking the
  time to answer each question in my bullet-pointed list spewed from my
  stream of conscious.  It was a great discussion.</p>
<p>By the time Marissa had returned from dog class, I felt like I had
  done over an hour of talking.  Marissa needed my help loading garbage
  into the car for a trip to the dump, and the physical labor sounded
  like a nice change of pace.  &#8220;We can drop the stuff off at the dump
  before lunch,&#8221; she explained.  &#8220;Nothing feels better than returning
  from the dump with an empty car, and that will make lunch so much
  better.&#8221;</p>
<p>We started with the old resin table.  Remember the one caked with old
  resin, latex gloves and plastic gloves stuck to the surface like a
  post-modern art installation?  Well that post-modern piece has camping
  out on our deck, too large to fit into the shed.  We hauled it into
  the trunk, followed by bags of garbage, pvc poles, and the remaining
  wood from the basement bookshelf that I tore down.  With the car
  packed, we made our way behind Hy-Vee and pulled into the dump.
  Rodney was on high alert, vigilantly watching out the window, waiting
  to point out every police car, bucket truck, and bulldozer that came
  into view.  &#8220;We found out yesterday that sometimes ambulances, fire
  trucks, and police cars fill up on gas here,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;So
  really you need to be ready to see <i>anything</i> at the dump.&#8221;</p>
<p>We parked, got out, and flung each piece of garbage into the
  appropriate dumpster.  Last to leave was the resin table.  Marissa
  started to flag down an attendee for help, but before she could find
  someone, I hoisted the table into the dumpster myself, grunting as the
  wood slammed against the metal floor.  &#8220;You know how you read about
  those mothers that have so much adrenaline, that they can lift a car
  by themselves to save their baby or something,&#8221; I explained as we
  pulled out of the dump.  &#8220;I think that&#8217;s what happened to me back
  there.  I <i>hated</i> that table so much, I was able to channel that hate
  and, in the heat of the moment, pick it up by myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>We parked the car at glass nickel to head inside for lunch.  &#8220;You&#8217;re
  right,&#8221; I said jumping out of the passenger seat scanning the empty
  trunk.  &#8220;This is the best feeling in the world.  I&#8217;m excited for lunch
  now.&#8221;  Marissa smiled as we headed inside.</p>
<p>We enjoyed a easy, long lunch at Glass Nickel, though we were
  dissapointed to hear that our favorite waitress no longer works there.
  Rodney still acted like he owned the place, flagging down our waiter
  to show him crayon drawings and the toy planes he took with him.  I
  enjoyed a beer while we talked about the week.</p>
<p>We returned home, and I worked through the rest of the afternoon while
  Rodney and Marissa napped.  At 5, I crept into Rodney&#8217;s room to wake
  him up.  The two of us went to Hy-Vee, and I had only the faintest
  idea of what to make for dinner.  My grocery list just said &#8220;meat&#8221; and
  &#8220;vegetables&#8221;.  Together, we ended up picking up some cod, shallots,
  brussels sprouts, and a can of baked beans.  &#8220;I think tonight we can
  make a mignonette sauce,&#8221; I said to Rod, remembering we had a can of
  cream in the fridge.  Back at home, I did my best to wrestle Rodney
  away from the counter while I cooked the cream sauce, roasted the
  sprouts, and seared the lightly breaded fish.  I had a plate of cold
  butter chunks on the counter, and Rodney swiped one of the cubes off
  the plate, thinking it was cheese.  I kicked him out of the kitchen
  until dinner was ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;The baked beans are a bit of a non sequitur,&#8221; I said plating up the
  food at the table.  &#8220;But I know I mentioned them this afternoon before
  falling asleep, and you were probably excited about them.&#8221;  I suppose
  there&#8217;s worse things you can pair.  The sweet, sugary baked beans went
  pretty well with the tart cream sauce.  And as always, cooking the
  fish to a delicious crisp was effortless, thanks to my new battle axe
  of the kitchen, my 14 inch non stick skillet.</p>
<p>Marissa put Rodney to bed so I could get a jump on some code.  Last
  night, I wrapped up the new wallpaper manager I added to our family
  website.  I put on a little demo for Marissa in our room, showing how
  you could upload family photos to the site, and how they automatically
  get added to the desktop wallpaper rotation.  &#8220;Each computer in the
  house runs a little script that asks for a random photo from our NAS
  and updates the wallpaper every ten minutes,&#8221; I explained.  With the
  extra time after dinner, I also wired up an RSS feed.  &#8220;My goal is to
  make this website useful for pretty much everything we do.&#8221;  We spent
  the rest of the night working on chores.  Marissa painted the basement
  floor, which after our hard work, dried beautifully smooth and level.
  We crashed on the couch with snacks and drinks at the ready.  It was a
  good night.</p>
<p>Hope you have a happy Thursday, and thanks for reading.</p>
