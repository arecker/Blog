excerpt: sandwiches, soup, groceries, and routines

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Wednesday.  It is day three of our
  Madison working Staycation.  Last night while putting Rodney to bed, I
  used my fingers to count the remaining evenings - Wednesday, Thursday,
  then we leave sometime Friday morning.  I&#8217;m sure he appreciated the
  sync up, but I was mainly reviewing the facts for myself.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;m happy to be a little closer to regularly scheduled
  programming.  I took the dogs for a little walk around the block so
  Ziggy could poop.  When I returned, I gave them their scoops of food
  in plastic tupperware bowls, then took a hot shower before once again
  leaving the house to cross the street and pick up coffee.  Yesterday
  morning, I bought a bag of ground coffee from the same coffee shop,
  thinking I could hold it down back at the house with the provided
  Mr. Coffee machine.  But Mr. Coffee had other plans.  Mr. Coffee
  spewed water and grounds all over the place - leaking down the side of
  the pitcher and pooling on the kitchen counter.  Later that evening
  while preparing for dinner, I would do a dry run brew cycle with just
  water, and sure enough, the same angry sputtering mess ensued.  Talk
  about bad flashbacks to the Mr. Coffee life.  God, I miss my
  Moccamaster.</p>
<p>I worked through the morning, attending some morning meetings from the
  couch in the much cooler basement.  Around lunch time, we packed up
  and went for a walk down the street to Madison Sourdough.  Rodney
  ordered the PB&amp;J of the kids menu.  &#8220;Great choice,&#8221; said the woman at
  the counter.  &#8220;I was actually going to have one of those for lunch
  myself,&#8221; she continued.  Rodney&#8217;s sandwich was a regular PB&amp;J, but
  served on this beautiful thick house made toasted white bread, with a
  side of fruit and whipped cream.  Marissa also ordered well - she got
  a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, and bacon.  Then there&#8217;s me - I
  went with the cashew burger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought this would be more of an <i>impossible burger</i> situation,
  like with some deception at play, but the peanuts are very pronounced
  here,&#8221; I said peeling the bun apart.  &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like if you were
  to take a bunch of boiled peanuts and step on them with a work boot -
  a <i>very clean</i> work boot,&#8221; I continued.</p>
<p>I worked through the rest of the afternoon before joining Marissa
  upstairs on the couch.  I plugged in the little super nintendo tucked
  in the corner and played some Ninja Turtles.  Marissa sleepily smirked
  and chuckled from her reclined position on the couch while I got my
  ass kicked.</p>
<p>Marissa got Rodney up from his nap.  I followed her down the stairs,
  making a grocery list.  We packed the dogs, then jumped in the car,
  headed toward Hy-Vee.  It was a further drive from Willie Street, but
  my heart felt fuller the further we drove into familiar territory.
  Even Rodney started to perk up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed something about vacations,&#8221; I blurted out while we
  waited at a red light.  &#8220;Being away from our house is tiring, and now
  the whole dynamic makes sense to me.  I think when we travel, we get
  tired out having to adapt to a sudden transition and new routines, and
  we try to compensate for it by going out, having extra drinks,
  and getting new experiences.&#8221;  Marissa nodded along in understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since this isn&#8217;t really a <i>fun</i> trip per-say - I&#8217;m still working, and
  we don&#8217;t have anything fun planned, this week is a good opportunity to
  turn down one of the channels and listen to the other more closely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;Explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; I said shaking my head.  &#8220;I think I jumped into an analogy
  without setting it up.  I was picturing recording a song in garage
  band, and if you have two tracks to your recorded song, it will let
  you mute one so you can just listen to the other in isolation.&#8221;
  Marissa nodded while driving, and I continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the act of leaving the house takes a big toll on our energy and
  stresses us out.  Without us trying to make up for it by having fun,
  that effect is much easier to observe, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I think I follow now.&#8221; said Marissa.</p>
<p>I think the take away here is that I think when we travel anywhere, we
  should take our routines with us.</p>
<p>We parked at Hy-Vee.  Marissa pulled into the <i>expectant mothers</i>
  parking spot.  Before leavng the car, she unzipped her coat adjusted
  her baby bump.  &#8220;I need to look pregnant.  Whenever someone parks in
  this spot, that&#8217;s the first thing everyone does, right?  You check if
  the person is pregnant.&#8221;  She craned her neck in the front seat of the
  car, miming the scenario she was describing.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said after a hearty laugh.  &#8220;That&#8217;s definitely just you.
  Don&#8217;t worry, you earned the right to park here.  You look <i>very</i>
  expecting,&#8221; I teased patting her belly.</p>
<p>At Hy-Vee, we picked up leeks, shallots, a six pack of beer, and some
  other snacks.  Back at home, we cued up a playlist of water slide
  videos for Rodney.  Discovering the YouTube app on the house&#8217;s living
  room TV was another powerful force for reestablishing a sense of
  normal.  Marissa sat at the bar while I cooked soup, struggling to cut
  the leaks with the blunt knife and flimsy cutting board.  &#8220;Look, this
  thing might as well be a giant butter knife,&#8221; I said, holding up the
  giant chef&#8217;s knife and skimming the blade against my palm.  Rodney
  visited the kitchen three times for pieces of cheese.  After cooking
  the soup, I used a drinking glass to ladle it into Styrofoam bowls and
  ripped up a loaf of bread with my hands.  We sat at the dining room
  table and ate.</p>
<p>Perhaps I was just projecting, but I could almost feel the fruity
  onions and shallots gently breaking up the taco chips, pizza, and
  donuts that had been sustaining me.  Marissa slumped back in her
  chair.  &#8220;Well I feel better,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do too,&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;I think everything with me comes down to
  food.  I literally feel back at 100% at this moment,&#8221; I said buttering
  another piece of bread with our shared plastic knife.</p>
<p>This morning, Marissa is taking the dogs to agility class.  Rodney and
  I are going to camp out in the house for a while, then we&#8217;ll go for a
  walk down Willie Street and find some place with WiFi to sit with
  computer and coloring books.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day today.  Thanks for stopping by.</p>
