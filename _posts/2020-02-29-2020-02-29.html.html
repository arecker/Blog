excerpt: moving out, moving in, portillo's, and carrot soup

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing well on this Sunny leap
  day.  It feels so good to be back in my own room at my own computer
  drinking my own coffee.  Our home is even better than I imagined it
  would be.  This morning, I&#8217;m grateful for home.</p>
<p>This morning, we all woke up on the later side.  I woke up to Rodney
  hooting and jumping around in his room.  I changed him, then ushered
  him bottomless down the stairs to dig a fresh pair of pants and
  underwear out of his bag in the kitchen.  After setting him up with
  some cartoons on the couch, I got to cooking breakfast.  This morning,
  I had a meager supply to work with - just two eggs and one potato
  leftover from last nights soup.  I diced the potato, rinsed it, then
  taking extra care not to spill any of the little cubes, dried them on
  a paper towel before shallow frying them in olive oil.  I toasted some
  pieces of bread and cut them into wedges.  I scrambled the first egg
  for Marissa and cooked the second sunny side up, excising some of the
  whites for Rodney&#8217;s plate (and that&#8217;s not me being stingy, he actually
  prefers the whites!).  As a finishing touch, I scraped the near empty
  container of creme friache in the fridge clean to make two dollops for
  the potatoes.  Not a bad breakfast for just a potato and two eggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I slept the best I have ever slept,&#8221; said Marissa coming down the
  stairs and joining us at the table.  I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This morning when I woke up, I was so comfortable it felt like I was
  floating in warm water.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had a crazy day yesterday.  It was a blur of code, slack, packing,
  and remote meetings.  We had to check out of our rental house by
  eleven, and even with our packing game at peak form this past week, it
  still took 45 minutes to scour the house and get everything in the
  car.  With Marissa and Rodney in the car with ten minutes before
  checkout to spare, I did a final walkthrough of the house.  Just
  before locking the door, I swiped an energy drink out of the fridge.
  I felt I had earned that one.  The day we moved in, the owner texted
  us with instructions to remove it from the freezer.  Apparently the
  cleaning crew had left it behind.</p>
<p>After locking the door behind me and leaving the key in the lock box,
  we finally made our way home.  Our house looked like an empty art
  gallery.  The floors looked so bright and healthy.  We spent a few
  minutes pacing around, observing the rooms in our home.</p>
<p>&#8220;They look new, but they still look like our floors,&#8221; I said shuffling
  my feet.  &#8220;Does that make sense?  I was worried they would look too
  showy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Marissa in agreement scanning the floor with her eyes.
  &#8220;They look so good, I don&#8217;t even remember what they used to look like.
  Weren&#8217;t they orange or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa and I dragged the couch and chairs out of the kitchen.  I
  hooked up the TV and Marissa set up some of Rodney&#8217;s toys.  Marissa
  ordered Portillo&#8217;s, which arrived at our door shortly after.  &#8220;I
  ordered a lot of food,&#8221; said Marissa while opening the paper bags.
  &#8220;Just&#8230; brace yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>In our half assembled dining room, we sat around the table silently
  and viciously devouring chicken, burgers, Italian beef, and fries.  I
  felt like I wanted to sleep and run around at circles all at the same
  time.  &#8220;OK,&#8221; I said dabbing my mouth with a napkin.  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
  jump online&#8230; you good?&#8221;  Marissa flashed me a thumbs up while
  chewing.</p>
<p>I worked the rest of the afternoon from our chair in the empty living
  room.  I was pulled into an urgent project, and would need to have a
  demo ready by the afternoon.  &#8220;OK Nate,&#8221; I said in our remote sync up.
  &#8220;I just wolfed down a lot of Portillo&#8217;s and I&#8217;m feeling good.  This is
  the last thing that stands between me and a nap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nate chuckled.  &#8220;OK,&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I worked, Rodney joined me in the living room watching ninja
  turtles.  He jumped off the couch, and circled me with his makeshift
  ninja swords, trying to entice me in combat.  &#8220;DADA.  YOU&#8217;RE
  SHREDDER,&#8221; Rodney yelled, widening his stance and brandishing his
  weapons.  &#8220;Not now, dude,&#8221; I said, fending him off while running shell
  commands and bouncing between chrome tabs on my laptop.</p>
<p>Marissa put Rodney down for a nap, and I plugged in my laptop upstairs
  and joined the meeting just as Nate was introducing our work.  The
  demo went smoothly, and after one final debriefing meeting, I shut my
  laptop and slumped in my chair.  With Rodney sleeping in his room and
  Marissa asleep on the couch, I happily sneaked out of the house to go
  to the grocery store.  As I passed through the dining room, I recoiled
  in surprise.  Marissa had practically finished putting the whole house
  together.  All that remained was a duffle bags in the corner of the
  dining room.</p>
<p>I returned from the grocery store and got to cooking dinner, letting
  the smell of carrot soup slowly wake Marissa and Rodney up from their
  naps.  Once again, we sat down at our dining room table, but it felt
  different this time.  The adrenaline was finally starting to wear off,
  and our house was feeling more complete.  Nothing winds you down like
  a good bowl of soup.</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, we unpacked a bit more, then called it a
  night a little earlier, retreating to the couch to catch up on Better
  Call Saul.  After finishing the episode, we went to bed and sailed off
  to sleep.</p>
<p>We have a fun day planned today.  We have some more things to unpack -
  my closet is still empty, our rugs our rolled up in the basement, and
  our books are still packed up, but we&#8217;re taking it slow this weekend.
  We&#8217;re going to run some family errands, and we&#8217;re kicking around the
  idea of celebrating our homecoming at Dave &amp; Busters.</p>
<p>It feels good to be home.  Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you have
  a relaxing weekend.</p>
