excerpt: blueberry muffins, remote control cars, jackpots, and bad waiters
---
<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  It feels good to roll over into a new month,
  doesn&#8217;t it?  And where I&#8217;m writing this, the sun is warm, and stepping
  outside I can feel every ounce of this hgih-of-fifty-degrees weather.
  Way to go, March of twenty-twenty.  You&#8217;re off to a strong start -
  keep it up.</p>
<p>After rolling out of bed around 8:30, I threw on my hoodie and made a
  quick drive to Hy-Vee.  We needed some things for breakfast, but most
  importantly, our stash of Marissa&#8217;s choice pregnancy craving - the
  irreplaceable and addictive Hy-Vee Blueberry Muffins (with the sugar
  coating) - was completely depleted.  <i>Careful now</i>, I muttered to
  myself carrying the groceries into the house.  Still half asleep, I
  was imagining the scene from Balto where they unload the life saving
  serum off of the sled - an apt analogy that really captures how
  important these muffins are to Marissa, I think.</p>
<p>I got to simultaneously cleaning the kitchen, putting groceries away,
  and cooking breakfast.  I clarified some butter, preheated the oven,
  and whipped up a batch of Dutch baby batter.  I laid a half pound of
  bacon on the skillet and clambered on a chair to remove the batteries
  from our smoke detector.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the middle of my Sunday breakfast routine, Rodney
  barrelled down the stairs and happily greeted me.  He had in hand a
  tiny remote control car that he had won at Dave &amp; Buster&#8217;s the night
  before.  &#8220;Morning DADA,&#8221; he chirped, still in his PJ&#8217;s.  &#8220;Open it for
  me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure dude,&#8221; I replied, checking the bacon quietly sizzling on the
  stove from the corner of my eye.  I pried the truck free of its
  plastic and cardboard restraints.  &#8220;We need some batteries,&#8221; I said,
  whipping open the kitchen drawer and digging around for the
  screwdriver set.  The bacon began to sizzle more loudly as I found the
  appropriately sized phillips head.  I grabbed a pair of tongs and
  gingerly turned each strip of bacon, then dabbed up the grease with a
  wadded paper towel before kneeling down to finish assembling the car.
  I imagined I was disarming a bomb, and with clarified butter smoking
  in the oven, hot bacon on the stove, and an anxious toddler waiting to
  play with his new car toy, that was easy to imagine.  &#8220;There,&#8221; I said,
  setting the car on the table.  I wrapped my fingers around the
  controller and applied pressure to the tiny joysticks.  The car
  whirred to life.  I handed Rodney the controller before he excitedly
  ran after the car.</p>
<p>At last, I set the table for breakfast.  Marissa sleepily wandered
  into the dining room and grabbed a cup of coffee.  A smile spread
  across her face when she saw two packs of her muffins waiting on the
  counter.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s eat,&#8221; I said, pulling the skillet out of the oven.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a <i>we&#8217;re not leaving the house for a while</i> kind of
  breakfast,&#8221; I said taking off my apron and joining everyone at the
  table.</p>
<p>We needed a big meal this morning.  Last night, we went out to eat at
  our favorite BBQ place, and the experience went down hill.  We were
  hoping to get in and out relatively quickly, saving plenty of time for
  video games at Dave &amp; Busters.  But 45 minutes into patiently waiting
  at our table, the light hearted joking turned bitter.  &#8220;The people
  behind us are eating,&#8221; said Marissa, gesturing with her eyes.  I
  nodded.  &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;And the people behind us finished.  We
  sat down the same time they did.&#8221;  Marissa caught the waiter standing
  by the bar.  He looked like he was urgently trying to get a word in.
  &#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;He forgot to put our food in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The host emerged from the kitchen with a tiny plate of fries and a few
  ribs.  &#8220;This is from the kitchen,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Sorry about the wait,
  the cook said he wanted the kid to have something to eat.&#8221;  Marissa
  took the plate, and we all nibbled on fries while Marissa scraped the
  meat off the bones.  The host reappeared, this time with his attention
  to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad news for you,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;We&#8217;re out of ribs, was there something
  you wanted instead?&#8221;  I laughed, glancing at Rodney&#8217;s plate.  &#8220;Dude,
  what an honor,&#8221; I joked.  &#8220;You got the last ribs.&#8221;  I turned to the
  host.  &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have the brisket.&#8221;</p>
<p>The host, our waiter, and other people from the kitchen appeared
  moments later with a fleet of plates.  Our waiter handed me a second
  beer, the shortly after the bartender approached our table with the
  same beer.  &#8220;I think that&#8217;s a duplicate,&#8221; I said gesturing at my full
  glass of beer.  The bartender offered it to Marissa, who meekly turned
  it away.  She remained at the side of our table for a moment, trying
  to convince me to drink it, mumbling something about how <i>it&#8217;s already
  on the table</i>.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it,&#8221; I said a little more assertively.</p>
<p>Marissa took Rodney to the bathroom, and as I said eating my plate,
  from the corner of my eye I could see the host and the waiter staring
  at me while I ate.  The waiter made a few conspicuous laps around the
  dining room, either glancing at me or asking me how things were each
  time he passed.  I started to get agitated with the extra attention.
  It was clear our waiter was overcompensating in the spirit of damage
  control, and I hated how it felt.</p>
<p>We paid or tab and left.  We had about a half hour to play games at
  Dave &amp; Busters, and for a while it felt good to forget about our
  dinner experience.  Rodney played a spin-to-win game and scored a
  jackpot earning him a free spin.  An electronic alarm bell resounded
  through the arcade, as the blinking and jittering screen flashed <i>1000
  POINTS</i>.  Rodney spun the wheel again.  Jackpot again.  The alarm rang
  much more loudly like a fire alarm with the same sustained ringing for
  two minutes while the machine slowly counted up to 2000 points.  I
  half expected the Dave &amp; Busters bouncers to come out of the back room
  as people walked by, openly complaining about the alarm noise.  &#8220;This
  machine is HOT!&#8221; I yelled, as we wandered away to find another game.
  With almost 4000 points to spend at the end of our brief gaming
  session, the entire gift shop was his oyster.  He picked an extra
  large sticky hand, a dinosaur hand puppet, and a remote control car.
  &#8220;THANK YOU,&#8221; he yelled in a tiny voice over the roar of the busy
  arcade.  The girl at the counter beamed back at him, waving us on.</p>
<p>After getting home, Marissa put Rodney to bed, then we both got to
  cleaning up the house.  Suddenly realizing how late it was, I started
  to feel angry.  We had spent most of the night waiting for our food at
  the BBQ place.  As I stood in the kitchen washing dishes and putting
  food away, my thoughts raced.  My teeth gritted as I mentally
  rehearsed reaming out the waiter that had forgotten to put our order
  in.  Marissa&#8217;s muffled voice could be heard in the kitchen.  &#8220;What?&#8221; I
  said sharply, turning off the sink and leaning into the dining room.
  &#8220;I can&#8217;t hear you from in there, I have no idea what you&#8217;re saying.&#8221;
  Marissa became sad, staring down at the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m really upset about dinner tonight, and I
  need to talk about it.&#8221;  I continued to think while cleaning for a
  little while longer.  After reaching a stopping point, she joined me
  on the couch with a bottle of water.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve been screaming at that
  waiter in my head.  I think I&#8217;m really angry and bitter, and after
  thinking about it, I think it clicked,&#8221; I said.  Marissa patiently
  listened on the couch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m actually mad at myself for not sticking up for us.  I know we
  joke about how we have bad luck with waiters and eating out, but I&#8217;m
  worried that we&#8217;re pushovers, you know?&#8221;  Marissa nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but you&#8217;re right,
  you have a point,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just so upset that we left that place, and I was the one who felt
  crummy.  That place should have been embarrassed, it took us an hour
  to get our food, and we had a three year old sitting at the table.
  Rodney went to bed late, we had less time at the arcade - it kind of
  messed up the whole night.  We wanted to finish putting the house back
  tonight.&#8221; I said, wringing my hands in frustration.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;We should have made a plan, and walked
  away.  Yelling at the waiter wouldn&#8217;t have solved anything, but
  absolutely should have just left.&#8221;</p>
<p>I perked up.  &#8220;Yeah, I like that,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;Next time this happens, I
  think we should just leave.  I should have walked over to our waiter
  and just said &#8216;Hey, this took way too long, and I&#8217;m sorry but we&#8217;re
  leaving,&#8217;.  I wouldn&#8217;t have to make a scene out of it, but at least I
  don&#8217;t just hold onto the frustration and take it out on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; - not that it&#8217;s their fault I snipped at you,&#8221; I continued.  &#8220;I&#8217;m
  sorry about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I feel good about where we left things, and I&#8217;m grateful Marissa had
  the wisdom to help us find a middle ground.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s just have a plan
  next time,&#8221; she repeated like a refrain.  I nodded.  &#8220;This feels good.
  I feel like I would normally just hold onto this anger.  I should have
  acted, and left all this at the restaurant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by today.  Thanks for reading, and I hope you have
  a wonderful Sunday.</p>
