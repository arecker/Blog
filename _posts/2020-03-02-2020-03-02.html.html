<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Thanks for stopping by.  I hope you&#8217;re
  prepared to begin another work week.  I know I am.  After a chaotic
  week of working ticket duty, being on-call, and living out of a
  suitcase in an AirBNB, I&#8217;m ready to bring things back to basics.  I&#8217;m
  looking forward to going into the office and resuming my regularly
  scheduled life without all the drama that comes with re-treating wood
  floors.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after a long &amp; full breakfast, we remained at the
  table a little longer digesting our food before Rodney got antsy and
  asked to play in the living room.  I brewed another pot of coffee, and
  Marissa and I moved to the couch where we watched a sermon on YouTube.
  It was one of those weekends where we needed some church, but
  understandably didn&#8217;t have the energy to leave the house.  Once
  church-from-home concluded, we moved the party upstairs to get ready
  for the day.</p>
<p>It was such a delight heading outside wearing nothing but a hoodie.
  This time a year, even fifty degree weather makes you want to go for a
  long walk in the park and spend as much time outside as you can, and
  the evidence was all over town.  The bike bath teemed with people
  running, biking, and walking their dogs.  As we drove around, I
  dwelled on all the outdoor activities we had gone without all winter -
  sitting at the biergarten, eating outside, and going for walks around
  the city.  I think it&#8217;s going to be a wonderful Summer.</p>
<p>We made our way all the way over to the Westside.  Now that the floors
  were finished, the next undertaking we selected as a family was the
  living room fish tank, and we set aside yesterday to stroll around
  Pet World and gain inspiration.  But before that, we parked at
  Culver&#8217;s for a family lunch.</p>
<p>As we made our way through the parking lot, I stopped in my tracks at
  a black car parked in front of us, my attention drawn to the single
  bumper sticker which read, <i>F__k you, and that piece of shit you call
  a car.</i>  &#8220;Look at this bumper sticker,&#8221; I said beckoning Marissa
  over.  &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a strong statement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Marissa strolling over.  &#8220;And it&#8217;s the <i>only</i> bumper
  sticker.  That means something.&#8221;  We stood for a few moments pondering
  the sticker, and imagining the type of person who would stick that on
  their car.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not even a very nice car,&#8221; I said, moving around the
  back, pointing out the scuffs and scratches along the old exterior.
  &#8220;It&#8217;s just incredible that somebody would put that on their car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try to sit by a window so we can see who gets into it,&#8221; said
  Marissa heading inside.</p>
<p>Nobody ever got into the car, but we had a nice lunch at Culver&#8217;s.
  Marissa and Rodney ordered a kids meal so they could get a free scoop
  of frozen custard at the end.  &#8220;Did you save the bags?&#8221; asked
  Marissa as I set out chicken and fries.  I took on a worried look,
  then darted to the nearby garbage, fishing out two crumpled bags.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, rejoining them at the booth.</p>
<p>We scarfed down our food, and when we finished, I started to clown
  around with Rodney&#8217;s dinosaur puppet while he finished eating.  I
  mimed the dinosaur head at the edge of the table, pretending to steal
  a french fry out of my own hand on the way to my mouth.  Rodney&#8217;s
  cackle could be heard through the entire restaurant.  After finishing
  some frozen custard, we walked across the street to pet world.</p>
<p>Rodney excitedly scanned the walls for animals, pointing out the fish,
  lizards, hamsters, rabbits, and even a <i>kitty Samuel</i>.  That&#8217;s the
  name of the cat at Ollie and Ziggy&#8217;s vet office, and Rodney has come
  to assume that <i>kitty-samuel</i> and <i>cat</i> are interchangeable terms.  We
  took our time by the saltwater fish.  Marissa studied the clown fish,
  and her attention was drawn to a poster on the wall.  &#8220;See, look at
  all the different breeds of clownfish you can get.&#8221;  She called me and
  Rodney over - we were distracted by a large black scorpion that was
  temporarily removed from its tank by a Pet World employee.  Marissa
  called us over to the poster again, more assertively, triggering my
  teasing instinct.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a break from the exotic animals, Mom
  wants us to stare at a poster,&#8221; I said directed toward Marissa.
  &#8220;C&#8217;mon Rodney, did you think we were here to look at animals?  We TOLD
  you we came here to look at the fish posters, so that&#8217;s what were
  going to do,&#8221; I said in feigned scolding.  &#8220;Did you get enough time at
  this poster?  Do you need a half hour?&#8221; I continued.  Sometimes I
  wonder if I take things too far.</p>
<p>Once we had our fill looking at animals and - more importantly - the
  fish poster, we made our way home.  Rodney went down for a nap and I
  slipped out the house to go to Hy-Vee to buy dinner.  &#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful
  outside,&#8221; I said to my fried at the meat counter while he wrapped up
  my tuna steaks.  &#8220;In fact, I think I&#8217;m going to grill these - first
  time firing up the grill this year.&#8221;  He nodded in approval and sent
  me on my way.  Back at home, I lit the grill and prepared a kale salad
  while waiting for the charcoals to heat up.  I grilled three tuna
  steaks, serving them with salad and some toasted bread with sesame
  seeds.</p>
<p>Once we had finished dinner, things started to get serious on the
  chore front.  Marissa and I had a goal to finish putting the house
  together this weekend, starting with Rodney&#8217;s room.  We moved his
  bookshelf and unpacked his suitcase while we scampered around the
  upstairs floor in his pajamas before he joined me in our room for
  evening workouts.  Of course we don&#8217;t actually make Rodney workout -
  he just has enthusiasm for anything that extends his bedtime routine.
  In our bedroom, we did push-ups, sit-ups, and aided by a new pull-up
  bar I picked up from Target for my closet door, some sit-ups as well.
  I held Rodney by the waist so he could get the pull-up experience.
  /THERE I WAS IN MY APARTMENT, DOING PUSH-UPS, GETTING STRONG,/ we
  chanted quoting our favorite spider-man movie.</p>
<p>Out of breath, I flopped down in Rodney&#8217;s bed and read him a story
  before saying goodnight.  Marissa and I spent the rest of the evening
  moving things up from the basement.  All the <i>schlepping</i> has spun off
  into a weird joke where Marissa refers to me as &#8220;schlep-man&#8221;, or said
  as one word, <i>schlepman</i>.  She orders me around like a wealthy
  aristocrat.  <i>Uh, SCHLEPMAN.  I wish to read my book about DOGS,/ she
  says in an airy, withering voice.  /Fetch it for me at once!</i></p>
<p>We concluded the night in our bedroom, filling the project board with
  new tasks for the week.  It feels liberating to move onto new goals
  and projects.  This week, I&#8217;m rebuilding our NAS on some new, slimmer
  hardware, and we&#8217;re taking the first steps toward prepping the fish
  tank.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day, everyone.  Thanks for reading.</p>
