excerpt: pizza, ninja turtles, and our european friends

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p><i>Goedemorgen, mijn vrienden!  Hoe gaat het vandag?</i> I hope you&#8217;re all
  feeling good today.  It&#8217;s Friday, and looking outside, there is plenty
  to be thankful for.  I&#8217;m thankful that we&#8217;re heading into a weekend,
  which will yield lots of time to catch up on things around the house
  and find some rest.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling good today.  I decided to work from home today.  With the
  coronavirus scare still building to a crescendo, the remote work
  option has become very popular, even to the point where staying home
  is encouraged.  And before climbing into bed last night, I stood for a
  moment staring at my desk.  Comfortable, well-lit, a good pair of
  headphones and a good microphone - I&#8217;m looking forward to spending the
  work day here.</p>
<p>Yesterday was another busy work day where I was in and out of meeting
  rooms&#8230; pretty much all day.  Some point between all the bouncing
  back and forth, I joined my desk neighbor Julia back in our corner.
  &#8220;We have&#8230; thirty minutes until the next meeting.  What are we even
  supposed to do?&#8221; I griped.  Julia laughed.  &#8220;I know, right?&#8221; she
  replied.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not even enough time to start anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Around lunch time, I took advantage of another half hour micro break
  to walk across the street to pick up my favorite sandwich from the
  cheese shop.  As I usually do, I cut the sandwich in half, labeling,
  bagging, and sticking the extra wedge in the fridge to save for
  Marissa.  And as I&#8217;m writing this now, I realize that I had no further
  plans for that half of sandwich.  We&#8217;ll see if it&#8217;s still there when I
  return to work on Monday.</p>
<p>I finished our final meeting at 4, where are team remotely introduced
  ourselves to a new engineering manager we hired.  My laptop was
  practically depleted from all the running around I did away from my
  desk, and when the meeting wrapped my battery was literally at 1%.  I
  shut the lid and jumped on a bus homeward.</p>
<p>I wanted to get home a little early to get a jump on the pizza.  Last
  night, I invited Rafael and Miguel, who were visiting from our Dublin
  office, over for dinner.  When I walked in the door, Marissa was
  already busily putting things away.  Rodney emerged from his room
  cradling a hand full of Ninja Turtles action figures.  In the kitchen,
  I got to making the pizza, beginning with the sauce.</p>
<p>Olive oil, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and two cans of whole
  peeled San Marzano tomatoes later, I left the sauce on the stove to
  simmer and began making the dough.  Marissa joined me in the kitchen
  to wash the lettuce for the salad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I admire how hosting people brings out the best in you,&#8221; I said to
  Marissa breaking the busy silence.  I chuckled, realizing my
  spontaneous complement <i>could</i> be received as a sleight.  What about
  when we&#8217;re not having people over?  Is she at her worst then?  The
  road to offending your wife is usually paved with good intentions.</p>
<p>I kid. Marissa was gracious about it.  Touched - not offended.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what are their names again?&#8221; asked Marissa, straightening up the
  pillows in the living room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rafael and Miguel,&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;They work in Dublin, but I think
  they are both from Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa stood thinking for a minute.  &#8220;Man,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s going to
  be really difficult not referring to them as <i>Rafael</i> and
  <i>Michaelangelo</i>,&#8221; laughed Marissa.</p>
<p>Our guests arrived at the front door.  Marissa greeted them as I
  herded the dogs into the back yard.  Rodney handed them each a foam
  sword on entry before they even had a chance to remove their quotes.
  Rafael and Miguel rose to the occasion, joining Rodney in sword combat
  before even learning his name, and you have to admire that easy going
  attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Rodney.  Excuse him, he is really into Ninja Turtles right
  now,&#8221; I said.  Marissa&#8217;s eyes lit up, as if she had a joke at the
  ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;We were sort of tempted to refer to you two as
  Rafael and <i>Michaelangelo</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Michaelangelo!&#8221; Miguel replied enthusiastically.  &#8220;Well,
  really it&#8217;s <i>Miguelangelo</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s close enough!&#8221; I said.  How strange of a coincidence!  In the
  past week, it feels like the theme of Ninja Turtles has descended on
  my life.  I see it everywhere.</p>
<p>After Rodney&#8217;s excitement subsided, we released the dogs from the
  backyard into the house, and they incited a second wave of enthusiasm
  in the living room.  &#8220;They&#8217;ll calm down after five minutes,&#8221; Marissa
  clarified.</p>
<p>We ushered Rafael and Miguel into the living room, took their coats,
  and hooked them up with some beer from a sampler pack Marissa had
  picked up from Hy-Vee.  Miguel presented us some chocolate they had
  brought from Ireland.</p>
<p>As the pizzas finished in the oven, we made our way back to the living
  room and rested on the couch with TMNT playing quietly in the
  background.  We got to chatting, covering the basics - how long
  they&#8217;ve each been with the company, their role, and what got them
  there.</p>
<p>Sitting down at the table with pizza and salad, I finally steered the
  conversation into cultural curiosity.  &#8220;So I just have to say it,&#8221; I
  opened boisterously.  &#8220;That double kiss thing you guys do at the door
  is pretty damn charming.  Do you just do that for the ladies, or was I
  supposed to kiss you too?&#8221;  Rafael and Miguel blushed in
  embarrassment, laughing.  &#8220;You know it gets awkward sometimes,&#8221; said
  Rafael.  &#8220;Sometimes you go to kiss someone twice, and they were only
  expecting to kiss once.&#8221;  He mimed the awkward situation, bobbing his
  head around and widening his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s like your version of the handshake-fistbump debacle that
  can happen sometimes,&#8221; I laughed.  &#8220;I wonder what it would take to
  bring that to the US?&#8221; I laughed.  &#8220;We could just start kissing
  people, and I&#8217;m sure it would catch on eventually.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rafael and Miguel spoke more to their unique perspective of Ireland,
  originally emigrating from Spain.  &#8220;I almost gave up and moved back on
  the first day,&#8221; Miguel shared.  &#8220;I just arrived in Ireland.
  Exhausted, carrying a hundred pounds of luggage.  I wanted to order a
  big mac.  &#8216;Big Mac&#8217; I said, then they guy behind the counter asked me
  a question, and I had no idea what he was saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He got frustrated,&#8221; continued Miguel.  &#8220;Then finally looked at me and
  gestured.&#8221;  Miguel silently used his hands to gesture &#8216;big one&#8217; or
  &#8216;little one&#8217;.  &#8220;How was I going to live there, find my way around,
  attend meetings at work, when I couldn&#8217;t even order a Big Mac?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rafael chimed in.  &#8220;I get frustrated in cabs.  I thought I could speak
  English, but I can&#8217;t understand cab drivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conversation wandered from accents, to politics, to culture.  I
  was a little fuzzy on Irish &amp; UK relations, and at one point I had
  completely forgotten that Spain got quite a bit of snow.  &#8220;Have you
  guys ever made a snowball?&#8221; I asked condescendingly.  Rafael&#8217;s eyes
  widened.  &#8220;Alex!  Spain has snowy mountains!  Of course I&#8217;ve made a
  snowball.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re grateful you guys visited with us,&#8221; I said as our evening came
  to a close.  &#8220;You see, as Americans we can now brag that we were
  entertaining our <i>European friends</i>,&#8221; I said twirling my hand to
  emphasize the exotic appeal.  &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s going to think we&#8217;re so
  cultured now.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re grateful Rafael and Miguel spent time with us.  What a wonderful
  evening.  Thanks for stopping by this morning.  Stay safe out there.
  To our Zendesk friends visiting the Madison office, I hope you make it
  home safely and remain healthy in the coming months.  Have a great
  Friday, everyone!</p>
