<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re having a wonderful Saturday.  The
  weather outside is absolutely beautiful, and I&#8217;m thinking about taking
  Rodney out to tool around on our skateboards.  But I made the fateful
  mistake of divulging these tentative plans to him too early in the
  morning.  For the first hour or so while I let the dogs out, made
  coffee, and cleaned up the kitchen, Rodney didn&#8217;t leave my side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rod, do you want to go watch TV or something?&#8221; I asked, looking down
  at Rodney who was limply holding onto my leg and fiddling with a
  cabinet nob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;NO,&#8221; said Rodney.  &#8220;Ummm.... first we go SKATEBOARDING.&#8221;</p>
<p>I decided to make the most of his time and put him to work in the
  kitchen.  He helped me fry a pair of eggs for breakfast, empty the
  dishwasher, and reload the paper towels.  All the morning chores must
  have temporarily made him forget about skateboarding.  Don&#8217;t worry,
  we&#8217;ll head out once I&#8217;m doing with the morning journal entry.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do a recap of yesterday, shall we?  Yesterday was a wonderful
  day.  My decision to work from home made for a funny coincidence.
  Before our morning meeting, my manager pulled me into a quick 1-on-1
  over Zoom.  &#8220;With this whole health scare thing getting incrementally
  more serious,&#8221; he began.  &#8220;I expect the recommendations to employees
  to avoid travel and work remotely to get more and more intentional and
  prescriptive.&#8221;  I nodded and Heath continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like our team to get ahead of things and just commit to working
  remotely indefinitely.&#8221; Heath continued.  My eyes lit up and I
  smalled.  &#8220;I think that&#8217;s a great idea,&#8221; I chimed in.  &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot
  of wisdom in that.  That seems to be the direction things are headed
  in, so we may as well start figuring out how to do that now.&#8221;</p>
<p>I finished the call with Heath, then headed downstairs to refill on
  coffee.  Marissa awoke and joined Rodney on the couch.  &#8220;So it looks
  like I&#8217;m going full remote for the foreseeable future,&#8221; I said to
  Marissa, beaming with good news.  I grabbed a foam sword for a
  celebratory sparring session with Rodney.  Seeing Marissa take out her
  phone to send a snapchat, I continued to run through our living room
  yelling <i>I&#8217;M NEVER LEAVING THE HOUSE AGAIN</i>.</p>
<p>Marissa took Ziggy to Sports Zone to work on her mural.  Rodney and I
  shared some leftover hash at the table, then I returned to work.  I
  worked the rest of the afternoon with a renewed enthusiasm and
  motivation.  Before our final meeting of the day, I fixed a hot cup of
  ginseng tea and put Rodney down for a nap.</p>
<p>The work day ended, and while waiting for Marissa to return from
  Sports Zone, I decided to take another stab at getting the new server
  to boot.  After watching an instructional video for clearing the CMOS
  on an ASRock board, I really thought I was onto something.  In a last
  ditch effort to diagnose this motherboard, I took my router apart,
  swapping the parts in to test.  I narrowed it down to either the
  memory or the board itself.  Marissa peeked her head in the door.
  &#8220;Sorry, I need like five minutes,&#8221; I said sitting amongst computer
  parts and cables scattered on the floor.  &#8220;I need a few minutes to put
  everything away and calm down a bit, this really worked me up,&#8221; I said
  calmly.</p>
<p>After cleaning up my mess, I joined my family downstairs.  We jumped
  in the car to run some Friday errands.  First stop was the mattress
  store, which was a quiet little shop on the way to the mall.  We
  chatted with the salesman and, after some deliberation about our
  budget, picked a twin bed for Rodney.</p>
<p>While ringing us up, the topic of kids came up.  &#8220;I was a youngest
  child, and let me tell you how I got my nickname.&#8221;  Taking a step back
  from his computer, he delved into a lengthy story about how he earned
  the nickname <i>varmint</i>, and how his nieces and extended family still
  call him that.  &#8220;I would have spent the extra $50 to skip that story,&#8221;
  muttered Marissa to me as we returned to our car, the new twin
  mattress wedged tightly against the roof above our heads.</p>
<p>Next stop was the mall.  We parked and headed inside, Rodney taking
  his Ninja Turtle action figure with him.  We found a seat at the food
  court and ordered from the Chinese Cajun place - our favorite hidden
  gem in Madison.  &#8220;It&#8217;s so funny how this is literally the best Chinese
  food we&#8217;ve found in the city,&#8221; said Marissa as we dug into chicken,
  rice, lo mein, and a bag of hot crab rangoons.</p>
<p>After eating and leaving the food court behind, we began our hunt for
  new shoes.  We had a hard time committing to a shoe store, drifting in
  and out of various athletic department stores.  Rodney was feeling
  especially social, smiling, greeting, and waving at people like he
  owned the place.  I also noticed that he still yells <i>Happy Holidays</i>
  to people as parting words.</p>
<p>Marissa found a pair of light up spider-man shoes at Shoe Carnival.
  It was love at first site for Rodney.  As soon as we strapped him in,
  he took off running, jumping, and swinging around the shoe store.
  Marissa also picked out a new pair of shoes.</p>
<p>Not seeing anything I liked at Shoe Carnival, we returned to the
  Zumiez store on the other side of the mall.  I went right for the
  sleek black adidas shoes I was eyeing earlier in the evening.  A
  younger girl with piercings, wearing ratty skate clothes rung us up at
  the counter.  &#8220;I like your turtle,&#8221; she said to Rodney.  &#8220;Want a
  sticker?&#8221;  Rodney eagerly peaked his head into the bucket, fished out
  a sticker, and planted it on his cheek.  &#8220;That&#8217;s a great place for a
  sticker,&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;HEY - WATCH THIS!&#8221; Rodney yelled.  He strained to contort his fingers
  into a new shape, then held out his hand to show her.  &#8220;That&#8217;s
  awesome, dude.  I don&#8217;t think I can do that.&#8221;  She and Rodney chatted
  for a few minutes while I rang up my card, entered my pin, and
  signed.  &#8220;Come visit me, OK dude?  I think you&#8217;re funny,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; replied Rodney.  &#8220;Happy Holidays.&#8221;  We waved and left the
  store returning to our car.  &#8220;This is an exciting day for us,&#8221; I said.
  &#8220;Is there anything better than new shoe day?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by this morning.  As for me, I need to follow up
  on my promise and get Rodney to the skate park.  He&#8217;s lost interest
  with story bots and started to, in a very literal sense, bounce of the
  walls.  Have a great Saturday, everyone.</p>
