<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everybody!  I hope you are having less trouble than I
  was waking up this morning.  I sat up in bed, seeing it was 10:00, and
  after a few minutes wondering why it felt like 9:00, things started to
  make sense.  &#8220;I hate the time change,&#8221; said Marissa, rolling over next
  to me.  &#8220;This is the unfun one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s the time change today, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; I griped,
  rolling over to my feet.  Rodney was already busily shuffling around
  his room and ready to join everyone downstairs for Breakfast.</p>
<p>Today is day two of Ziggy&#8217;s agility trial.  Not long ago, Marissa left
  with Ziggy for Rockford, and just the Recker family men are holding it
  down back at the house today.  I sat Rodney down at the table with a
  plate of three Dutch Apple fruit bars, and by the time I poured a cup
  of coffee and returned to the table, he had already added a dozen more
  to his plate.  &#8220;That&#8217;s way too many, dude,&#8221; I said, joining him at the
  table.  I reached for one of his many fruit bars.  Rodney protested by
  swatting his hand at mine.  &#8220;NO&#8230;&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Not Dada&#8217;s.
  <i>Rodney&#8217;s</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three of us - Ollie, Rodney, and I - had a real adventure
  yesterday.  Yesterday after Marissa left with Ziggy, we suited up and
  departed for the Goodman skatepark like a slow caravan.  I had Ollie&#8217;s
  leash in hand kicking my skateboard along the sidewalk, and Rodney
  dragged his green scooter behind him.  Of course, Rodney had his
  swords with him sheathed in the neck hole of his sweater.</p>
<p>Rodney began buzzing with excitement as the Goodman park came into
  view, running ahead of us to stake his claim.  I scooted a rusty hand
  rail over to a sunny spot on the pavement and tied up Ollie, who
  contentedly took his place, laying with his chest puffed out like a
  watchful lion.  Rodney and I skated around for an hour, going up and
  down ramps, racing across the vacant basketball court, and even making
  snowballs out of the thawing snow on the shady side of the park.  I
  took a break, letting Rodney climb around on the jungle gym while I
  sat with Ollie.</p>
<p>Before long, a father and his younger sun wandered over to the
  playground.  The four year old kid was carrying a skateboard.  &#8220;EXCUSE
  ME,&#8221; the boy yelled articulately.  &#8220;DO YOU WANT TO RIDE SKATEBOARDS
  WITH ME?&#8221;  Rodney leapt off the rope ladder and ran over.  <i>BLISHH
  BLSH BUGH SKATEBOARD SWORDS?</i>, he replied.  The two boys stood there
  for a moment twenty feet from each other shouting over the empty
  playground.  Taking the initiative to start an impromptu play date, I
  wandered over and grabbed Rodney&#8217;s board.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it, dudes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rodney ran ahead with Elliot, dragging his green scooter behind him.
  The two boys ran around the park, fought with swords, and tried each
  others skate boards.  Elliot showed Rodney how to ride on his board
  from his belly, using his hands to propel forward.  I skated around
  the two.</p>
<p>Taking a break, I got to chatting with Elliot&#8217;s dad.  He had moved to
  Madison from Rockford.  &#8220;I&#8217;m from Illinois too, I actually used to
  live in Rockford,&#8221; I said.  I could tell Tim relieved to let his guard
  down and share more descriptively.  &#8220;I&#8217;m still a real Illinois slob,&#8221;
  he said.  &#8220;The people here drive way too slow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the water doesn&#8217;t taste very good,&#8221; I added.  Tim&#8217;s eyes widened.
  &#8221;<i>YES</i>&#8221;, he resonated.  &#8220;It&#8217;s so hard!  We&#8217;ll leave our cats water
  bowl out for a few days, and this white ring of calcium will form,
  it&#8217;s terrible!  I really miss the spring water we had in Rockford.&#8221;</p>
<p>It felt good to commiserate with, as he referred to himself, another
  <i>proud flatlander</i>.  &#8220;Nobody around here wants to hear someone from
  Illinois complain about things in Wisconsin,&#8221; I later shared with
  Marissa.  &#8220;So I usually just keep all these complaints to myself.  It
  was nice to hear it from somebody else for a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we chatted, Elliot became fixated on Rodney&#8217;s foam swords while
  Rodney blissfully played with his skate board.  Tim looked on, visibly
  worried.  &#8220;We&#8230; had to take away all Elliot&#8217;s swords recently,&#8221; he
  shared.  &#8220;They just get him too excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five minute warning, dude,&#8221; I yelled to Rodney.  &#8220;We gotta go pick up
  groceries.&#8221;  Rodney looked up and nodded.  Meanwhile, sensing that his
  time with the swords were coming to an end, Elliot started to get
  nervous.  Tim walked over to Elliot to try to coax the foam swords
  away.  Out of frustration, Elliot ran to the top of the skateboard
  ramp and flung them over the edge defiantly.  Rodney looked on in
  amusement.</p>
<p>As Tim consoled Elliot, we bid farewell to our new friends.  &#8220;We come
  here a lot,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see you around.&#8221;  Rodney and I
  skated away.</p>
<p>We dropped Ollie off at the house, then made our way up East Wash to
  the Taco Bell.  Rodney and I ordered lunch and found a quiet sunny
  table in the dining room.  The employees were very friendly with us.
  One worker emerged from behind the counter and surprised us with a
  pair of gooey cinnamon donuts.  Unsurprisingly, he turned to me,
  segueing into professional, but insistent plea to fill out the
  customer survey and call him out by name.  The employees get some kind
  of kick back.  &#8220;Yeah, ha - I know the drill,&#8221; I nodded, getting out my
  phone to oblige him.  Whatever they&#8217;re doing, it&#8217;s working.  That Taco
  Bell is one of the few fast food restaurants on that street that
  doesn&#8217;t disgust me.  <i>EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING</i>, I typed.  <i>ESPECIALLY
  GORDON.  I SPECIFICALLY WANT TO CALL OUT GORDON, HE WAS THE BEST</i>.</p>
<p>We left Taco bell and made the walk to Jenny Street.  Fueled by taco
  energy, Rodney left his hoodie in the wagon and ran ahead of me,
  pumping his tiny arms and periodically glancing down to watch his new
  light up shoes pound the pavement.</p>
<p>As we shopped, Rodney started to crash.  We returned home, and I put
  him down for a much needed, well-earned nap.  We made the most out of
  the first nice day of the year.</p>
<p>By the looks of it, it&#8217;s shaping up to be an even nicer day today.  As
  it&#8217;s Ollie&#8217;s birthday today, we&#8217;re going to take him to the gourmet
  dog treat store in Atwood, and we might hit the skate park on the way.
  Hope you have a wonderful day today.  Thanks for stopping by.</p>
