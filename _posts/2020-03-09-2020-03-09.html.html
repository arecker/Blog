<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re feeling good today on this Monday
  morning.  It&#8217;s really dark outside today, no doubt a result of the
  time change.  The older I get, the more this whole daylight savings
  thing seems to baffle me.  If we just left everything alone, the days
  would slowly and gradually wax and wane, and we wouldn&#8217;t have to deal
  with sudden changers like this.  But here we are, instead the clocks
  lurching forward all in a single day, and now it feels like I woke up
  in the middle of the night.  The sun is slowly starting to creep in
  the house now, so at least I have some daylight to help wake me up.</p>
<p>I had a wonderful day yesterday.  In the morning, Marissa left for
  Rockford with Ziggy, leaving me, Rodney, and Ollie seated around the
  table.  &#8220;OK, dude.  Let&#8217;s come up with a plan,&#8221; I began, moving seats
  to the computer.  Rodney looked up in confusion, mid chewing an apple
  cereal bar.  &#8220;Top priority is making sure Ollie has a special
  birthday,&#8221; I continued.  Ollie, who was splayed out on the wood floor
  beneath the table, perked his head up attentively.</p>
<p>Rodney and I got ready for the day, then after brewing a quick pot of
  coffee to-go, headed down the sidewalk.  Ollie was already carrying
  himself differently - more proudly - as if he knew he was the star of
  the show.  Rodney tagged along behind us with shuffling steps,
  carrying the football in his arms.</p>
<p>We first made our way to the dog treat shop in Atwood, which is a
  lengthy walk, especially without our wagon.  Heading inside, Ollie was
  mobbed with attention from people in the store.  &#8220;It&#8217;s his birthday,&#8221;
  I announced.  A girl from behind the counter offered him a treat, and
  Rodney wandered off into the tiny shop digging through the shelves.
  We picked Ollie up a braided bone chew and a special dog friendly
  cupcake.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how old are you today?&#8221; asked the girl behind the counter,
  bending down toward Ollie.  I froze up, arriving at a mental block,
  distracted by holding Ollie&#8217;s leash and keeping Rodney out of
  trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is&#8230;&#8221; I froze.  &#8220;I have no idea.  I want to say six-ish.&#8221;  I
  quickly bailed, using Rodney as an awkward situation buffer.  &#8220;OK,
  Rodney, put that back on the shelf it&#8217;s time to go.  Say buh-bye!&#8221;</p>
<p>We wandered out of the shop and continued down the road toward our
  house, stopping at a bench.  I let Ollie finish his cupcake sitting
  under a shady tree by a park bench.  Rodney and I split a chocolate
  chip granola bar, then tossed the football back and forth.</p>
<p>Realizing it was getting pretty late into the afternoon and that we
  were still a ways from home, I decided to shift my attention towards
  finding a place to eat lunch.  Remembering that NextDoor had an
  outdoor patio, we set out toward the familiar brewery.  I stood in
  their front area awkwardly holding Ollie on a leash, following Rodney
  with my eyes as he walked around me in circles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you guys dog friendly?&#8221; I asked the waiter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, on the patio.  Meet me around back,&#8221; he said.  The brewery
  hadn&#8217;t yet set-up their outdoor seating, but the waiter was kind
  enough to pull us up a couple of chairs and let us eat on the broad
  wooden railing.  I latched Ollie to the fence in the corner of the
  patio and took out his bone.  He happily gripped it in his paws and
  got to chewing.  The waiter brought out a beer and a glass of milk for
  Rodney.  Rodney and I ceremoniously clinked glasses.</p>
<p>We called Mom up on the phone while we waited for our phone.  Putting
  the phone on speaker, I handed the phone to Rodney and let him ramble.
  He set the phone down on the railing and picked up his glass of milk.
  &#8220;Just a second,&#8221; I said leaning into the phone.  &#8220;Rodney wants milk,
  and they brought him a literal pint glass with no lid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sensing I was talking about him, Rodney decided to clown it up.  He
  gripped the glass and lapped at it with his tongue.  &#8220;Now he&#8217;s
  drinking it like Kitty Samuel,&#8221; I said into the phone through
  chuckles.</p>
<p>Rodney and I split a grilled cheese sandwich, paid our tab, and
  continued home.  Back at the house, I released Ollie into the backyard
  so he could continue working on his bone in peace.  Rodney and I
  grabbed our skateboards and tooled around our empty driveway.  The
  neighbor kid Derrick from across the street joined us for a bit,
  taking turns riding our skateboards down the driveway and
  demonstrating what tricks we&#8217;ve been working on.  Rodney took my board
  and rolled down the driveway on his belly.  I trotted ahead of him to
  stop the board with my foot before he reached the street.</p>
<p>I put Rodney down for a nap, and after some protesting, he fell
  asleep.  I hacked on my website for the rest of the afternoon.  I&#8217;m
  pretty excited about turning my blog into a custom, installable jekyll
  plugin.  It&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/arecker/jekyll-recker">jekyll-recker</a>, if you want to check on my
  progress.  Funny enough, it&#8217;s probably the only side project I have at
  the moment that ships with a nice, readable set of instructions.</p>
<p>Marissa returned home with Ziggy, and after catching up while crashing
  on the couch, I left for Hy-Vee to pick up dinner and restock the
  fridge.  I returned with food and got to chopping mushrooms into a
  stuffing, cutting the fresh cod meat into chunks, tossing them in
  flour, and pan frying them in oil and butter.  Also, just for kicks, I
  fried some tiny shallot rings.  The meal was a good idea, but moving
  too quickly, I got a little heavy handing with the seasoning and the
  final product came out just a bit too salty.  Even my mouth was
  feeling dry after dinner.</p>
<p>Marissa put Rodney to bed, and after catching up on chores, Marissa
  and I reconvened upstairs for our Sunday night planning.  &#8220;This week
  has been discouraging,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;We didn&#8217;t get a lot done, and it
  felt like we ran into problems.&#8221;  Marissa tiredly nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we prioritized too many things,&#8221; I said pointing at the
  board.  &#8220;We got fish tank stuff, Miles&#8217; room, the basement.  We were
  kind of all over the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;It was hard doing so much work in so many
  different rooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pick something to focus on this week.  Which of these piles is
  stressing you out the most?&#8221; I said, laying the clipped stacks of
  cards on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Definitely the studio,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult not having a
  good place to paint right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>We wrapped up our meeting, loading the board with brand new cards for
  the week, feeling more encouraged.  After watching some YouTube videos
  on the couch, we turned in for the night.  As we were getting ready
  for bed, we reflected on how wonderful this full remote experiment has
  already been.  &#8220;I feel like I have more time to do everything.  I can
  start cooking dinner earlier, and I can put things away around the
  house as I go,&#8221; OI said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the best part it these puppies,&#8221; said Marissa with Ziggy
  cradled in their lap.  &#8220;You pretty much never have to leave them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, and I wanted to mention,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;Let us know if you need
  more space or time to focus, I know this is a big change.&#8221;</p>
<p>I paused from fiddling around with my workstation and shrugged my
  shoulders.  &#8220;Thanks, but no difference yet.  Only thing I&#8217;ve noticed
  is we go through way more coffee at home now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by this morning.  I hope you have a wonderful day.</p>
