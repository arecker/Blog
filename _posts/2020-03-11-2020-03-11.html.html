excerpt: pizzas, dragon ball z, and the computer case
---
<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  How are you feeling today?  This week is
  finally starting to catch up with me.  I woke up especially tired
  today, shuffling down the stairs like a zombie with the dogs eagerly
  behind me.  As I sleepily brewed some coffee and put some dishes away,
  Ziggy sharply barked at the door, waiting to be let inside to eat her
  breakfast.  But now that I have at least a cup of coffee in my system,
  the engine is starting to warm up - so to speak.  We&#8217;re slowly getting
  there this morning.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a great day.  I spent the morning attending meetings from
  my room while Marissa worked downstairs.  Rodney played in the living
  room, listening to music.  At 12, I joined my family downstairs and
  heated up three bowls of leftover chili.</p>
<p>Following lunch, Marissa departed for Sports Zone to finish up her
  mural, leaving Rodney, the dogs, and I to hang out at home.  I worked
  from the couch while Rodney played, then later in the afternoon, I
  snuck upstairs to have a 1-on-1 with my manager.  I guess Rodney felt
  like he was missing out - a few minutes later he wandered into my
  room, craned his neck in view of the webcam and asked, &#8220;Dada, fight
  bad guys with me?  Pleease?  Please please pleeease?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We just discovered Dragon Ball Z,&#8221; I explained.  And as we all know,
  the correct way to enjoy Dragon Ball Z is by getting up off the couch,
  brandishing a sword or a hockey stick, and letting fly a flurry of
  punches and kicks as if you were in the fight.</p>
<p>After my last meeting of the day, I put Rodney down for a nap and
  fixed a cup of ginseng in the kitchen.  I returned to my desk, baiting
  the dogs to follow me with two training treats in hopes that they
  would hang out upstairs with me.  Sadly, after gobbling down the
  crumbled up treats in my hand, they flew back down the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing personal,&#8221; consoled Marissa.  &#8220;Our neighbors take the
  dog out in the afternoon, and <i>de honden</i> wait by the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even without the dogs, it was still a pretty cozy, quiet afternoon.  I
  cracked a window in Miles&#8217; room, letting the cool, wet breeze leak
  into the upstairs.  &#8221;<i>Mijn huis is gezellig</i>&#8221;, I said to myself before
  jumping back into work for a few more hours.</p>
<p>Marissa returned home, so I locked my computer and headed downstairs
  into the kitchen.  I decided to take a stab at California style pizza,
  remembering that I still had a pizza stone stowed away in our oven&#8217;s
  warming drawer.  As I mixed the dough, Marissa joined me in the
  kitchen to chat about the day.</p>
<p>Of all the pizzas in my repertoire, none of them give me the true
  pizza dough kneading experience.  Deep dish dough is soft, buttery,
  and is best underworked.  Sfincione is so gummy that it&#8217;s worked
  entirely in the mixer.  So needless to say, I was happy and feeling
  pretty cool that I got to practice my kneading technique on a classic,
  chewy pizza crust.  Marissa even took a turn kneading.  Who could pass
  up on a chance to play with some fresh pizza dough?</p>
<p>Setting the dough aside to rise, I left with Rodney for Hy-Vee.  I
  could tell he&#8217;s eager for spring to arrive - before walking through
  the parking lot, he rolled his pants up to his knees and the sleeves
  of his winter coat to his elbows.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s pizza was fun to shop for.  We mostly kept to the fun
  gourmet Italian section, picking up some fresh mozzarella, basil,
  pesto, proscuitto, <i>en een paar verse tomaten</i>.</p>
<p>Returning home, I released Rodney into the living room to watch TV,
  and while Marissa painted in the basement, I began cooking the pizzas.
  I cut the dough ball into sections and set them aside to proof on a
  mat while my oven pre-heated to 500 degrees.  The pizza stone still
  smelled of grill smoke, remnants of the last time I tried this over
  this past summer.  I flattened the dough, and using only my hands,
  spread the dough balls into little disks, taking extra care to leave a
  plump &amp; round crust around the outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;So pizzas are probably going to start coming out of the oven,&#8221; I
  called down to Marissa.  &#8220;I really didn&#8217;t put too much thought into
  the timing, so just come upstairs and we&#8217;ll start eating them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa and Rodney sat down at the table around the first batch.  I
  nibbled on a slice from a napkin while milling around the kitchen in
  my apron.  After the fourth and final pizza emerged, I joined my
  family at the table to finish them off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave any behind,&#8221; I said reaching for another wedge off the
  plate.  &#8220;The slices are so small and cute, I can&#8217;t stop eating them.</p>
<p>As we gathered on the couch to watch an episode of Dragon Ball with
  Rodney, I started to feel the pizza hit my stomach like a sleepiness
  bomb.  After Marissa went upstairs with Rodney for bedtime, I fell
  asleep in the middle of a Dutch lesson.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it about this pizza that just makes you want to sleep for
  hours?  I think I could fall asleep standing up right now if I wanted
  to!&#8221; I said, heading upstairs.</p>
<p>I managed to snap myself out of pizza stupor with some push-ups,
  sit-ups, and pull-ups, then I headed downstairs to do chores.  I
  finished cleaning the kitchen up at 9, leaving plenty of time for me
  to attack this week&#8217;s IT project.</p>
<p>When we last left off a week ago, I assembled the new parts I bought
  for the NAS, but they would&#8217;t boot.  Out of frustration, I returned
  everything and just decided to try to slim down the parts I already
  had with the goal of doing away with the giant, heavy, towering case
  balanced on the top shelf.</p>
<p>I powered down the wall and took everything apart on the bedroom
  floor.  I moved the hard drives into an external bay that my sister
  got me for Christmas.  They snapped in beautifully.</p>
<p>Next was the mother board.  I pushed the tufts of cables aside and
  removed it from the case, transferring it to the clean plexiglass
  mount.  I spent the rest of the evening rearranging things on my
  shelf, trying to find a configuration that hid the cables without
  putting to much strain on the plugs.</p>
<p>I hit the big red switch on my powerstrip.  The modem, router, and pi
  cluster powered on, but the NAS was silent.  The fan wasn&#8217;t spinning
  either.  Using a long VGA cable, I plugged the board into the monitor
  on my desk.  Still nothing.</p>
<p>Staring at the case, I remembered the power button.  I&#8217;ve always had
  problems with this computer not automatically turning on.  You need
  the little plastic button on the case.  So standing on a chair with
  the old metal case raised above my ahead, I gingerly plugged the end
  of the cable into the mother board.  I groped around the case for the
  plastic button, mashing it with my index finger.  The mother board
  whirred to life.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think I need to keep the case around,&#8221; I laughed while Marissa
  entered the room.  &#8220;Right now it&#8217;s the only way I know how to turn it
  back on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the button come out?&#8221; asked Marissa, inspecting it beside me.  I
  studied the button, and seeing a small plastic clip, popped it out of
  the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea.  I&#8217;d definitely rather keep a cable around than this giant
  metal case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Triumphantly, I flung the metal case into our garbage can and grabbed
  a beer out of the fridge.  It was a good day.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by this morning.  I hope you have a wonderful day.</p>
