excerpt: team lunches, remote work, and putting apple sauce on things
---
<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Thursday.  I hope you&#8217;re feeling good,
  and proud of yourself for making it this far into the week.  It&#8217;s a
  quiet and cozy morning.  It&#8217;s sort of chilly in the house, and I&#8217;ve
  settled into my desk with a zip-up and a fresh cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a great day.  To keep the social camaraderie going
  throughout this period of remote work, our team scheduled a lunch
  together.  I suggested the new Ian&#8217;s Pizza constructed in the new
  Garver Mill&#8217;s development in our neighborhood - Mine and Marissa&#8217;s
  usual watering hole for Wednesday lunch these days.</p>
<p>I attended some meetings before leaving to pick up Fong just before
  lunch.  &#8220;Alright, you ready to get lost?&#8221; I teased pulling out of her
  driveway.  &#8220;I walk along the bike path with my family to get there, I
  don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever driven there yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fong and I arrived, meeting Heath &amp; Julia in the foyer before queuing
  up for pizza.  We found a quiet booth in the back.  I ordered a beer,
  of course, in Wednesday lunch tradition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was excited about lunch,&#8221; I said as we all filed into a booth with
  plates of pizza.  &#8220;This is the most social thing I&#8217;ve done all week.
  I even put on a real outfit for the occasion - my <i>nice</i> sweat pants.&#8221;
  Some chuckles were heard before the conversation took us to remote
  work.</p>
<p>&#8220;UW just closed campus, they&#8217;re going full remote for this virus
  thing,&#8221; said Julia.</p>
<p>Heath laughed.  &#8220;I think a lot of people are going to realize that
  remote work is a lot easier than they thought.  Hell, you take a math
  class or something, and you don&#8217;t even need the professor there.  Just
  record the lecture.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took a swig of beer and joined the conversation.  &#8220;This virus thing
  has sparked a lot of conversation about remote work - not just at our
  work, but it&#8217;s all over twitter and LinkedIn - it&#8217;s like a remote
  revolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a mouthful of pizza, I continued.  &#8220;I bet this is how we
  transition into like what you see in sci-fi movies, where everyone
  remotes into everything and we just stay in our houses most of the
  time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even I was surprised at how easily I took to remote work this week,
  but in hindsight it&#8217;s kind of obvious.  I&#8217;m a home body.  I&#8217;m an
  introvert.  I&#8217;d prefer to wear the same thing every day if I can.  I
  like to work in bursts and do something active in between - at the
  office that means going for walks around the square, but at home I can
  wash some dishes or put things away.  I have more time to cook - at
  quitting time, I can start simmering something on the stove or set
  aside some dough to rise before running to the store.  I can help
  watch Rodney.  And all throughout, I seem to be more focused and
  getting work done.  It&#8217;s a great set-up.</p>
<p>Lunch concluded, and Fong left with Julia to swing by the office and
  pick up some things.  &#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; I said as we were walking back to
  our cars.  &#8220;But you&#8217;re not going to hear the rest of my mixtape, and
  that&#8217;s a real shame.&#8221;  Heath laughed and rolled his eyes as we bid
  farewell to each other.</p>
<p>Back at home, I had a quick snuggle with Ziggy on the couch, then
  jumped back online.  I took my laptop to the couch and worked while
  Marissa and Rodney worked on a puzzle in the dining room.  Marissa put
  Rodney down for a nap and I relocated to our bedroom.  One of our HDMI
  dongles finally arrived in the mail, which allowed me to plug in my
  secondary monitor.  &#8220;It&#8217;s perfect,&#8221; I said triumphantly tucking the
  cable behind the extra screen.  &#8220;It&#8217;s almost exactly the same setup I
  had at the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>After work, we decided to let Rodney sleep, and I left for Hy-Vee
  alone.  Marissa&#8217;s acid reflux has been a little tough, and after an
  exciting week of pasta, chili, and pizza, I decided to do something
  mellow for dinner.  I picked up a few chicken breasts, some brussels
  sprouts, and potatoes.  Back at home, I seared the chicken breasts,
  cooked the potatoes in rosemary and butter, and gently roasted the
  sprouts.  As I cooked, I enjoyed a <i>Stuff You Should Know</i> podcast.</p>
<p>After cooking, I gently shook Marissa awake on the couch and ushered
  Rodney over to the dining room before plating everything up, dumping
  some Apple sauce on each plate.</p>
<p>After dinner, Marissa cleaned up the living room with Rodney and put
  him to bed.  We stood on the deck for a while before jumping into
  Wednesday chores.  We got to talking about apple sauce, of all things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to play a game with your mom where I ask her when its OK to
  put apple sauce on things,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;And it seems like no
  matter what I say, she&#8217;ll think about it for a minute and just say
  &#8216;yes, you could put Apple Sauce on that&#8217;,&#8221; laughed Marissa.  &#8220;It kind
  of reminds me of that scene from the office where Jim is asking Dwight
  how long he could survive on his farm and he just keeps adding years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple sauce is useful,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;We kind of used to put it on your
  food the same way you put salt on everything.  Only it&#8217;s more useful
  than salt.  It cools things down, keeps your food from getting too
  dry, sweetens things, and you can use a lot to cover up a taste you
  don&#8217;t like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about salmon?&#8221; asked Marissa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.  I smoke it with apple wood, after all.  It&#8217;s basically
  the pork of fish, and pork tastes good with apples.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spaghetti,&#8221; suggested Marissa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah,&#8221; I said rocking on my heels.  &#8220;Well not with like red sauce
  spaghetti, anyway.  But maybe like buttered noodles, just heap some on
  the side.  And maybe some sliced tomatoes or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa laughed.  &#8220;How about pancakes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well yeah,&#8221; I replied.  &#8220;You serve fruit on pancakes, I don&#8217;t see the
  difference.  Maybe like some granola and apple sauce on the side, it&#8217;s
  basically a little parfait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doing it too!  I think you&#8217;ll literally just say yes to
  anything!&#8221;  laughed Marissa.</p>
<p>We headed back in the house, and I cleaned the kitchen.  I cleaned the
  fridge and pantry, and by the end of the evening before we convened on
  the couch to watch a movie, I was feeling very satisfied with our food
  situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at this,&#8221; I said to Marissa opening the fridge.  &#8220;Tomorrow we&#8217;re
  going to feast on all these leftovers for lunch, then we&#8217;re going to
  all nap after work, then we&#8217;re ordering Portillo&#8217;s for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by this morning.  I hope you have a wonderful
  Thursday.</p>
