excerpt: apple crappies, water bottle flips, and a note on hoarding
---
<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  We finally made it through another week.  I
  know I normally kick things off with a tongue in cheek congratulatory
  <i>we made it through a week</i>, but this week there is an uncomfortable
  amount of truth in that.  It&#8217;s been a crazy week, and more than ever
  I&#8217;m feeling grateful to be here writing at my desk on a Friday.  One
  more work day, than we&#8217;ll have a weekend to re-cooperate and figure
  things out.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a busy, social day.  Rodney stirred from his room in the
  early morning, sending his quiet <i>Guys?  Hello?</i> out into the
  hallway.  I got him out of bed and changed him, then together we
  headed downstairs so I could set him up with some breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to eat, dude?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ummm&#8230; <i>apple crappy</i>,&#8221; he replied, plopping down in his usual spot
  on the couch beside his stuffed animal.  I suppose that requires some
  context.  Rodney used to love Rice Crispy bars.  He refers to them as
  rice <i>crappies</i>, and from then on, any kind of snack just because a
  form of a <i>crappy</i> - including the Dutch Apple Fruit bars I started
  buying from Jenny Street.  In our home, they&#8217;re now known simply as
  <i>apple crappy</i>.</p>
<p>As Rodney remained on the couch and watched the ninja turtles, I
  returned upstairs with a big cup of coffee and commenced a very
  social, meeting heavy work day.  Marissa, Rodney, and the dogs filed
  in and out of my room throughout their morning routine as I attended
  morning stand-up, a design session, and an all-company meeting about
  the pandemic.  I flung my headphones off at 12 and trotted down the
  stairs to make some lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want some lunch, dude?&#8221; I asked Rodney boisterously while hopping off
  the last step of our staircase.  Rodney paused the TV and followed me
  into the kitchen.  I grabbed some slices of wheat bread and grated a
  block of white cheddar.  Using fresh mozzarella leftover from the
  pizzas, I made two grilled cheese sandwiches.  Also borrowing from a
  play out of Chef John&#8217;s playbook, I sprinkled cheddar cheese on the
  outside faces of the sandwich.  As the bread toasted in the butter,
  the cheese melted into the bread and turned crispy.  I joined Marissa
  and Rodney at the table with my own sandwich and plate of leftover
  brussels sprouts.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;m a little salty, family. I thought these sandwiches would be a
  bigger hit,&#8221; I said while chewing.  &#8220;Look at this!&#8221;  I pulled two
  slices of bread apart, revealing a gooey, melty center.  &#8220;Hey I&#8217;m
  sorry,&#8221; I continued.  &#8220;I just expected you bingisses to be raving
  about these sandwiches, but nobody is making a big deal out of them.&#8221;
  Marissa laughed, and Rodney picked up a wedge of his sanwich, nibbling
  off the corner.</p>
<p>After lunch, I headed back upstairs to finish out my workday.  Ollie
  followed close behind.  A half hour later, Marissa wandered into our
  bedroom looking for Ollie.  She stopped in her tracks, seeing Ollie
  contently curled up in my lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is so funny,&#8221; said Marissa.  &#8220;I think he really does like
  working.  He&#8217;s office dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;YEAH, maybe it&#8217;s time to get back to work, dad,&#8221; I said throwing my
  voice on Ollie&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s true.  Ollie being the <i>office dog</i> was part joke and part
  wishful thinking, but he dutifully lingered around my desk most of
  yesterday, his head perched attentively.  There&#8217;s a new slack channel
  at work where people are sharing pictures of their remote work setups.
  I stood on a chair to get a shot of my proud war room corner in our
  bedroom, and sure enough, Ollie can be seen laying beneath my chair.
  In the photo, he even looks a little annoyed with me that I paused
  work.</p>
<p>At quitting time, I locked my laptop screen and crawled into bed,
  hoping to steal a few minutes for a nap.  As soon as my head hit the
  pillow, I heard Rodney&#8217;s still, small voice in the hallway.  <i>Anyone?
  Guys?</i></p>
<p>&#8220;You wanna get up, dude?&#8221; I called back in the hallway.  Rodney
  appeared at the door in his pajamas, and after getting out of bed, we
  both made our way down the stairs.  Marissa ordered some Portillo&#8217;s
  delivery, and Rodney and I sat on the couch and watched YouTube
  videos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey mamma, watch this trick shot,&#8221; I said to Marissa getting up off
  the couch.  I grabbed a half empty water bottle of the table and
  flipped it towards the mantle.  It flopped on its side and tumbled to
  the floor.  I bent down to pick it up and try again.</p>
<p>Even thought water bottle flipping was only cool back in&#8230; 2012?  It
  has returned full force in our house.  Waiting for our food to arrive,
  we wandered around the living room with water bottles, calling out
  ledges and surfaces for trick shots.  Things even got a little out of
  hand while eating dinner.  &#8220;OK, NO MORE WATER BOTTLES,&#8221; shouted
  Marissa, collecting them from me and Rodney and hiding them in her lap
  for the rest of dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner, Marissa put Rodney to bed and I skated over to the
  Walgreen&#8217;s to pick up a prescription.  When I returned, Marissa was
  giving Rodney a bath upstairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toilet paper is in full stock over there,&#8221; I said.  Marissa pursed
  her lips and shook her head.  Of course we haven&#8217;t joined the panicked
  stock piling, supply hoarding crowd, but we&#8217;ve been keeping tabs on
  the situation for when we run out of toilet paper and need to buy a
  single pack - not for irrational end-of-the-world reasons - but for
  normal toilet paper reasons.  We had a working theory that the toilet
  paper stock would only be affected in stores where wealthier people
  shopped, and sure enough our lovable, sketchy Walgreen&#8217;s on the corner
  was unaffected.</p>
<p>While Marissa finished putting Rodney to bed, I practiced Dutch and
  flopped down on the couch besides Ziggy.  I sailed off to sleep for a
  glorious hour.  It was a much needed cheat for an exhausting week.
  Later that night, my internal bedtime skewed from the evening nap,
  Marissa and I sat up and chatted in bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re probably going to get sick, but we&#8217;re probably not going to
  die,&#8221; I said, putting my phone down in frustration.  &#8220;It&#8217;s so hard.  I
  want to stay informed of what&#8217;s going on, but there&#8217;s just too much
  commentary and here-say and people high-jacking this for their own
  shitty opinions.&#8221;  Marissa listened empathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried,&#8221; she replied.  &#8220;And it&#8217;s even got to my Facebook
  timeline.&#8221;  Marissa has always bragged about how she curated her
  Facebook follows to the point that, no matter what is going on in the
  world, her feed is limited to strictly happy dog related things.  &#8220;But
  even the dog people are going nuts about it,&#8221; she continued.</p>
<p>This is a scary time.  Even though the mortality numbers are
  dwindling, the whole thing has made me dissappointed in our behavior
  as a human race.  A few days ago, I made a salty tweet teasing the
  toilet paper hoarders for buying out stores, but I&#8217;d be lying if I
  said there wasn&#8217;t a real bitterness and frustration under that.  I&#8217;m
  disgusted with the people hoarding supplies.  The day I made that
  tweet, Marissa witnessed an old guy wandering around Target looking
  for toilet paper.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not stock-piling,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m out, and I
  just need one pack.&#8221;  And I think that story made me so angry, I had
  to make light of it so it wouldn&#8217;t eat away at me.</p>
<p>And the most evil thing about it is that the selfishness just leads to
  more fear.  People who normally wouldn&#8217;t think to hoard supplies in
  their basement see an empty shelf at Target or Costco, and an
  irrational fear is triggered, and soon their contributing to the
  problem.</p>
<p>Imagine studying a species at the zoo.  An animal that, at the first
  sign of danger, hoards provisions at the expense of the animals living
  around it is a dumb and selfish animal.  That doesn&#8217;t make for a very
  durable and adaptive species, does it?  Whether you&#8217;re a God fearing
  Christian and you think we serve a higher purpose to live meekly and
  care for people around us, or you just think humans are better animals
  than this, we all have plenty of reasons to show some courage and
  resist the urge to hoard supplies.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t hoard.  Stores like Target and Costco exist to distribute
  supplies in our society.  Maybe they shouldn&#8217;t be profiting off of
  that as much as they are, but I think emptying out a store shelf is an
  early, needless declaration of selfishness, and chances are if you
  were healthy and wealthy enough to stock pile essentials in your home,
  then you probably screwed somebody over who wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by this morning.  Stay safe, and be a good
  comrade - only buy what you need.</p>
