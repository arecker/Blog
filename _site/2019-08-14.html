    <p>Dear Journal,</p>

<p>Good morning, and happy Wednesday to everyone. I’m doing today’s journal
entry from our proud new dining room computer, which I just finished
building last night. I guess “building” is a generous term. I ordered an
Intel NUC, a stick of RAM, and a hard drive, and plugged everything in.
As per usual, way more time went into placing and wrapping cables -
which is absolutely an art form. This morning I’m filling the new
machine with games and other neat things. Marissa and I agreed that it
really jazzes up the dining room. Just having a computer here increases
it’s hang-out-ability by at least a factor of four. We have a nice place
to play music, pay bills, browse the web, and of course play games. This
weekend I’m going to set up a Minecraft server, so in short, it was nice
knowing all of you and the Recker family will see you next year
(kidding).</p>

<p>Yesterday was jam packed with meetings, cooking, and chores, but it was
a fulfilling day. I finally had a successful gravy recipe. Watching the
butter, flour, and stock combine is completely magically - I’m still not
even quite sure how gravy works, but the formula is simple and almost
feels like alchemy. Just watch - now I’m going to be incorporating gravy
into everything. Pizza. Pasta. Hot dogs. Everything is going to get a
hearty drizzle of homemade gravy! Also kidding.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to the weekend. Not only does my on-call
shift end on Friday, but I have a work picnic pretty much all day, and
that rolls into a long guys only weekend. My wife will be in Chicago for
my sister’s bridal shower, so Rodney and I are holding things down
ourselves. And we have a new computer to play with. I think on Saturday
we’re going to cook something together, like a deep dish pizza. Lately
when I make food in the kitchen, he drags our little step ladder out to
join me - which is undeniably adorable, but an extra element of
challenge. I need to make sure he feels useful without touching anything
hot, sharp, or raw. Making a pizza is very kid friendly, isn’t it? The
dough is fun to play with, and grating cheese is pretty benign, from a
kitchen safety perspective. It’s more fun for a kid than stir fry.
Rodney walked into the kitchen on Monday while I had a hot oily wok on
the stove and asked “ladder? ladder?” and I just turned him down, so I
owe him a long cook-with-dad session.</p>

<p>So this week, the interns and I are trying out a new thing. We’re doing
a pretty old school agile workflow, keeping all the work on hand written
index cards taped to a whiteboard. It’s a bit ironic, but I was taught
that’s the best way to teach people how modern software teams work.
There’s a lot of rules and terminology to learn, and having it all in
once place right in front of you without the distraction of software
makes it easier. It’s also a real learning experience for me - I’ve
never actually had to teach anyone agile or scrum, and it’s kind of fun</p>
<ul>
  <li>in an unexpected arts and crafts way. We’re taping, drawing, and even
putting little color coded stickers on things. Welcome to the future,
huh?</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, hope you have a wonderful Wednesday today. Cook with your kids -
something other than stir fry.</p>
