    <p>“What are your top five podcasts?” This question is all over the
Internet these days. I guarantee that if you put that on your Facebook
right now, you will come away with about eighty new podcasts to
try. Which is why you have to trust me when I say this: <em>Uhh Yeah Dude</em>
is something special.</p>

<p>When <em>Uhh Yeah Dude</em> joined my podcast queue about two years ago, it
immediately felt different. That’s because it doesn’t rush to hold
your attention. There’s no jingle, advertisements, or really any
immediate indication that you are listening to a podcast. Each episode
opens with a song plucked from a lovingly curated playlist, played in
its entirety. The music fades, the episode number is cited, and off it
goes for about sixty minutes before another song plays it out.</p>

<p>But who are they, and what are they doing? <em>Uhh Yeah Dude</em> is simply a
conversation between Hollywood locals Jonathan Larroquette and Seth
Romatelli. They weave between satire, commentary, story telling, and
cathartic venting all as part of a mediation best summed up by their
tagline, “America through the eyes of two American Americans.” There
are absolutely no inside jokes or context that needs to be revisited,
because somehow despite doing this show since February of 2006, Seth
and Jonathan live in the present. <em>Uhh Yeah Dude</em> is a conversation
about the here and now.</p>

<p>“Comedy Podcast” falls so short in describing what they do. Their show
is a performance art. You haven’t lived until you’ve heard Seth
incredulously dissect the Buffalo Wild Wings mission statement or
Jonathan recount the time he rescued a wild, exotic parrot from two
predatory birds on the side of the road. Their wild anecdotes and
satisfying mockery mixed with their quirky tendency to change topics
without warning will leave you wondering where the last hour of your
life went. Laughter is inevitable, but the second you confine the show
to “comedy podcast”, it will surprise you with something genuinely
poignant, touching, and honest. While no newspaper headline,
Craigslist personal, or Internet ad is safe from their wandering
banter, their originality and authenticity remain the constant forces
that tie the show together. Seth and Jonathan’s deep understanding of
each other is palpable, and even contagious to the point where you
feel like you are in that East Hollywood apartment snicking on the
couch with them.</p>

<p>And that familiarity is no accident - it’s crafted through numerous
live shows and other forms of active engagement with their
listeners. They even have a toll free voicemail that they encourage
listeners to call at any time of the day. They repeat the phone number
so often, it feels like a catch phrase. My wife called this number
about a week before my birthday with a pretty open ended request to
give me some kind of shoutout. You can imagine my excitement when I
found that Seth had left me a two minute long voicemail where he
leisurely read the horoscopes from his local newspaper.</p>

<p>I don’t know what else I can say about <em>Uhh Yeah Dude</em>, but somehow
leaving it in a brief “top five podcasts” list doesn’t cut it. This
podcast is like no other. It’s original, hilarious, thought provoking,
and a regular source of amusement and rejuvenation that I have come to
cherish. It’s time you fasten your seatbelt and give <em>Uhh Yeah Dude</em> a
try.</p>
