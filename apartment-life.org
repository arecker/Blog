#+TITLE: Apartment Life

I have to apologize, dear reader, for my lack of output lately. It was
all just bad timing. First, I decided to update every other week. I’m
still trying to find a good balance in frequency of updating – not as
much as a twitter feed and a bit more often than Haley’s Comet.

Secondly, I got sick. And if you think I was actually sick enough to
warrant your sympathy, step back. I’m in full realization that I’m a
man, and I completely shut down when I get a mere common cold. My
recovery for even the smallest throat tickle always involves
unplugging everything in the house that uses electricity, then lying
alone in bed in my favorite hoodie, whimpering into the silence until
my disease passes. When I get the strength to move, I walk to the sink
and drink three gallons of tap water, than wait until I have to pee.

Thirdly, I was ushered off by my work place to attend a training
seminar. I wasn’t allowed to use my phone (and my covert phone time
was taken up by trying to beat my fiance’s high score in Minion Rush –
priorities).

Leaving me here. At least a few weeks from my last post. Well here I
am, dear reader – I’m back from the dead and ready to tell you that I
am… surviving.

I shouldn’t be so melodramatic. By that, I mean the honeymoon phase of
living on my own is starting to wear off. It’s getting harder and
harder to become enthralled by the little things (like owning my own
set of keys, or having a tiny mailbox with my name on it) when bills
start to roll in and things start breaking. I am convinced that not a
single closet in my apartment closes right – which makes me wonder
whether or not I have been opening doors wrong my whole life.

Speaking of flaky blogging, Ben Parks [[http://benjaminnparks.blogspot.com/2013/10/yeah-yeah-i-know-i-said-i-would.html][updated]] his piece this week with
a rundown of his daily routine. I shouldn’t be so hard on
him. Necessarily, when he has the time to update, you know it must be
somehow important. Inspired by a peer, I have decided to do the same.

- 6:30 AM – Sit up and stare out my window. I also take the time to
  clear my throat about a hundred times
- 6:40 – Walk to the bathroom and sit there naked holding my arm out
  into the shower. I’ve always felt this scene would make a really
  good risque watercolor painting
- 6:50 – 7:15 – Actually showering now. I’m not really sure why this
  takes so long. I think I might be falling asleep or
  something. Someone needs to tell me what I’m doing wrong.
- 7:20 – Rinse out a bowl in the sink and fill it with raisin
  bran. Because it only takes me a minute or two to eat a bowl of
  cereal, I just continue to stand there and set it back in the sink
  when I’m done.
- 7:25 – Watch the Daily Show. I have to do this in the morning
  because my Internet is 10X faster at this time.
- 7:40 – Leave for work. Sadly, my car doesn’t begin to heat itself
  until I am fifteen minutes into the twenty minute drive.
- 8:00 – 4:00 – Working. But I take breaks and stuff. It’s funny when
  you feel the need to take a break but you don’t have anything to
  do. Besides eating lunch, I usually walk around the building or do
  other people’s dishes in the break room.
- 4:05 – Power off the laptop, then drive to Target. I buy a pack of
  trimmed asparagus and a red pepper, and maybe a bag of sunflower
  seeds if I am running low. I like to take a while to pick out the
  pepper. I squeeze it, hold it up to the light, and bounce it off the
  ground a few times as if I were really looking for something that
  would disqualify it.
- 4:30 – Ideally, I like to go skateboarding while my single chicken
  breast thaws in cold water.
- 5:15 – Cook dinner. The chicken isn’t too exciting, but I have
  really taken to making big, smoky stir fries in my enormous pan. A
  fly on the wall will hear me shout at least a few times ‘BAM! Kick
  it up a notch‘ as I flavor the chicken with the only spice I own
  (and the only spice you really need)- cyan pepper.
- 6:00 – Eat dinner. I sit on a lawn chair and watch Pawn Stars on my
  17 inch TV. Also, don’t tell my landlord that I am somehow getting
  the History Channel.
- 7:00 – 11:30 – I call this my time for chores, but let’s be honest,
  it just turns into a lengthy Grand Theft Auto session. A man’s got
  to decompress.

For your amusement, here are some shots of my pad:
