#+TITLE: Engaged

I’m sure Facebook has taken care of letting you guys know by now, but
Marissa and I got engaged last Saturday. I wish I could take credit
for everything that went down, but to be perfectly honest, I had no
idea what was going to happen. I never actually met any of the people
that helped out before Marissa did. Truth be told – I was just as
surprised as she was walking out onto the patio. Here is the full
story:

I started asking the internet for help with my big day about a month
ago. I had a basic idea of what I wanted. I wanted to do it at the
Shedd Aquarium, and I wanted a little quartet to play Crazier by
Taylor Swift . Subtlety was the goal here – which is why I chose to
post to reddit.com under the alias ‘BEAR_CIRCUMCISER’. You can read
[[http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1kvj6o/chicagoans_im_looking_to_hire_a_special_task/][the original thread here]] , but the gist of it was that I was looking
for a string quartet and connections inside the Shedd Aquarium in
Chicago.

The response was incredible. Tons of people were coming forward all
day. I was passing out my email like a cheap party magician. Not only
did I get plenty of willing decorators, photographers, but also
security detail, pilots, and even a piano on wheels.

I couldn’t get too far ahead of myself. I wasn’t going to let all this
excitement make awry the original plan. I wanted to keep it simple.

The first Redditor to commit was /u/ChicagoRex. He was a down-to-earth
university student who, in the fashion of a fast food fry cook,
churned out a gorgeous quartet arrangement of Crazier only a few short
days after my request. Great work /u/ChicagoRex. Nailed it.

Second to step up was /u/gobucks72, who was able to direct me to a
fantastic quartet. Clark Street Quartet was great to work with. I sent
them the sheet music once, and I didn’t talk to them again until
D-Day.

This was all good, but I still faced the daunting task of getting the
esteemed Shedd Aquarium to allow us to prance around their facility
close to and after closing hours. I didn’t really know what to do
besides pepper their ‘contact us’ link.

But another anonymous internet user to the rescue! /u/Nema_k piped up
about a friend who works in the Aquarium. This user was able to get
Marissa and me into the Aquarium for free. They even bought us tickets
to see the aquatic show.

Things were almost in place, but I was still in need of a photographer
and a videographer. /u/aweekendwarriorf and /u/mooseman90, who,
respectively, produced a gorgeous video and a series of really
beautiful pictures for the event. An additional shout to
/u/aweekendwarriorf ‘s wife for helping with decorations.

Again, this video was done by Charlie Hilbrant
(/u/aweekendwarriorf). This guy is also a pilot, so if you are looking
to spin around the Chicago horizon on a romantic aero-tour, you can
book that dream-come-true with Windy City Flyers.

#+CAPTION: As far as getting into a prop plane with someone you met on the internet, he’s basically the best you could ask for (sorry ladies… married).

Seriously, great people. It takes a lot of character to do as much as
they did for people they didn’t even know. I’m really thankful you
guys helped out.

Lastly, I can’t thank the Shedd Aquarium enough. I am so humbled that
they would bend over backwards like this for our special day, with the
only payment promised being that ‘I would have, like, a hundred kids
and buy them all Shedd memberships’. Particularly, I would like to
thank Denis Frankenfield, who suffered the brunt of my email spamming,
and Marco, our generous tour guide.

I really thank everyone who helped out – you taught me that the best
way to keep something a secret is to leave it up to a bunch of people
on the internet to keep it for you. What made the day really special
is that I was just as surprised as Marissa coming through those
doors. I’ve been kind of walking on air ever since. I don’t think I
could be happier now that I am engaged to the love of my life.

Thanks for reading, and see you at the wedding!
