#+TITLE: Escape

#+SUBTITLE: I offer up my perfect escape plan up for authoritative critique. Did I just break the way we patrol our highways, or am I really an idiot?

* I'm sorry, Google

I got a little catty last week. I wrote a commentary on a document
Google made hours after it was released. The document was ridiculous,
but it got a little moody at the end. I was especially paled when I
heard Fibre was getting added to a flurry of new locations (and is in
no way stagnating). Google is also doing what could be best described
as romancing a plethora of opensource robotics projects with Project
Tango. For last week, sorry Google.

* I need the police

But this week, I need the police.

Wait-a-minute… not one on duty or anything. That sounded a lot more
urgent then I meant it. What I meant is that I just need to run
something by an authority figure so I can get a sense of how valid it
is.

I think I have come up with the perfect escape plan. Disclaimer: I
don’t condone running from the police . I also don’t intend to use it
myself, and I would certainly regret any of my readers using it to
evade the law themselves. You could say that I am simply doing my
civic duty in helping the state lengthen the already long arm of the
law.

* The Scenario

You got a bad rap. Maybe you are walking on ice and eggshells after an
iffy murder charge, or you received a harshly-worded letter regarding
some illegally-obtained Shania Twain albums. Maybe you still have a
court date pending for that public drunkenness charge of yours at the
Apple store (even though nobody yet knows that’s just how you behave
around new Apple products).

The point is you can’t afford to get into trouble. You have to keep
your nose clean… which is why that it is problematic that you just got
pulled over on a rural highway by a State policeman.

There is no talking your way out of this one. Actually, it probably
won’t even be a ticket. You have an order on your head to be deported
and/or pistol whipped on site.

Fine – I don’t watch a lot of CSI, so consequently, I can’t escalate
this hypothetical scenario to a point where you would admit you have
nothing to lose. You are just going to have to get there without
me. There is literally nothing to lose at this point. You just need to
not get arrested tonight.

* My Plan

** Step 1: Floor the Car

You need to put some distance between you and the policeman. You need
to disappear into the horizon the best you can.

And don’t even tell me you won’t be able to do that. I learned from
watching COPS that a trained policeman won’t jump in his squad car
right away. Apparently, it’s better to stand there and get a better
sense of where the perp is heading (yes - you’ve become a perp at this
point, mind you). I don’t get it either, but it works to our advantage
for now.

** Step 2: Pull Over next to some trees or high corn

This is crucial. You need to pull over next to some place that looks
prime for escaping on foot. Don’t worry, if you follow my plan, you
won’t be doing a lot of running. The key is to only make it look like
you took off running. Turn off the car and open the door.

** Step 3: Climb into your trunk

You heard me. Get out of your car, climb into your trunk, and close it
right up.

Although my knowledge of police chase protocol comes up short here, I
would imagine it would happen something like this...

- State patrol spots your car pulled over and squeals to a grinding
  halt
- Policeman (and copious backup) jump out and inspect the scene with
  their guns drawn
- Policemen see that your car is empty. Using their instincts, they
  notice some bent foliage and conspicuous boot prints near the
  brushline (clever you)
- Search commences in the woods. They swarm the area with helicopters
  and maybe even landmines
- They can’t find you. They also don’t know what to do with your car
- “Meh. Call a tow truck. Let’s just go home. He was just a speeder
  anyway.”
- Cops go home. Before the tow truck arrives, you release the trunk
  latch from the inside (which in my understanding, is a safety
  requirement in modern sedans)
- Drive off, scrap the car (hand it over to Nicholas Cage to strip it,
  or whatever)

And call Bob your new uncle – you’re free to go. Sure – maybe it was a
little over-the-top, but I really think they don’t even train
policemen to check for something this stupid.

So I surrender my idea over to you Internet. I would be much obliged
if somebody stepped forward and set me straight, or, what I find more
likely, thanked me profusely for delivering more valuable
criminal-minded insight.
