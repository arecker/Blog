<p>
  Welcome to my online public journal.  I write <strong>1000
  words</strong> every morning, topics ranging from computers,
  cooking, raising kids, living in Madison, being Dutch, and
  everything else I come across in my daily life.
</p>

<p>
  I love chatting with people, especially over email.  You can find my
  email on the <a href="{% link contact.html %}">contact</a> page, as
  well as some other ways to creep on me.
</p>

<p>
  Do statistics get you going?  I track my word count and consecutive
  daily entries over on the <a href="{% link stats.md %}">stats</a>
  page.  I'm particularly proud of that one.
</p>

<p>
  Like to read code?  Check out my jekyll plugin <a href="{% link doc/index.html %}">jekyll-recker</a>.
  It's got twitter and slack integration, custom generators, and a
  bunch of other custom crap that - let's be honest - are probably
  only useful to me.  Other projects are featured on my <a href="{% link projects.html %}">projects</a> page.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for stopping by, and I hope to see you tomorrow morning!
