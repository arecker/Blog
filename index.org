** TODO Babel Index Generation

Generate a list of blog post files.

#+NAME: blog-post-files
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results list :exports both
  (let ((not-these			; this is lazy, I know.  I can't figure out the regex
	 '(".#index.org" "index.org")))
    (remove-if (lambda (f) (member f not-these)) (directory-files "." nil ".org")))
#+END_SRC

This one's a doozy - retrieve the title, subtitle, and date from each
document.

#+NAME: blog-posts
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var blog-post-files=blog-post-files :results list :exports both
  (mapcar (lambda (f)
	    (let ((data (with-temp-buffer
			  (insert-file-contents f)
			  (org-mode)
			  (org-element-parse-buffer))))
	      (append `((:file , f)) (org-element-map data 'keyword (lambda (el)
					       (let ((key (org-element-property :key el))
						     (val (org-element-property :value el)))
						 (cond ((string-equal key "TITLE") (list :title val))
						       ((string-equal key "SUBTITLE") (list :subtitle val))
						       ((string-equal key "DATE") (list :date val)))))))))
