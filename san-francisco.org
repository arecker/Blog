* Introduction

  My job is sending me to San Francisco for training.  While this
  doesn't sound like a big deal to some, I haven't done a lot of
  traveling.  Just take a look my Google Maps data since graduating
  college.

  #+CAPTION: This aerial view would make you think I'm a nomad that lives along I-90.

  I haven't been on an airplane in probably a decade.  I've never
  traveled alone.  I really have no idea how airports or other cities
  work.  For your amusement, I've decided to document my trip as I go,
  focusing on my mistakes and confusion.

* Sunday 5:50 PM CST - O'Hare Airport

  I departed this afternoon from Madison's only airport.  It was
  quaint, and just about everything the air travel experience should
  be.  Even the fellow that makes you remove your belt and shoes under
  threat of a baton beating was no more authoritative than they should
  be.

  When I arrived at the gate, we soon were shepherded to an airplane
  that was so small, it looked like it was cut out of a museum exhibit
  meant to teach kids about flight.  It was a proper metal cigar tube
  with wings.  But after buckling into my prime window seat, we were
  asked to leave.  The pilot called it a "VIP movement".  Apparently
  there was somebody traveling through O'Hare airport who was so
  important that all other planes needed to wait until he was done.
  The unenthused stewardist clarified that it was President Barack
  Obama.

  "Thanks Obama!" I whispered.  Nobody acknowledged my joke.  Perhaps
  it was too "on the nose".

  After milling around in the airport for another hour, we were told
  to board in the same fashion.  Pavement, stairs, window seat,
  seat belts, and finally lift off.

  The flight was comically quick.  We were only in the air for
  twenty-seven minutes.  I swear I've made the same drive in only two
  hours.  During the flight, we were assured that since the delay
  affected all flights in an out of Chicago, any connecting flights
  were likely still viable.  That was good news, but I figured I had
  better just treat it like it was still the same time printed on my
  ticket.

  O'Hare, in contrast to the Dane County regional airport, is a war
  zone.  People were practically stabbing each other for AC outlets.
  Parents shoving Mcdonalds cheeseburgers into their kids' mouths.
  Additionally, navigating this airport was considerably more
  complicated.  My target gate number looked like a foot note out of
  an obscure academic journal.  I followed its promise through a
  churning sea of angry, weary people.

  To my horror, arriving at gate H-11-A I beheld the great walkway
  retracting.  Despite what I had been assured, my connecting flight
  hat not been delayed.  It was still taking off at 5:00 PM, and I had
  arrived at 5:10 PM.

  As I waddled over to the desk, relinquishing my wife's blue polka
  dotted bag to the ground, a furious bald man stepped in line in
  front of me.  Veins swelled around his temples.  He had that "I'm
  about to make a scene" look about him.

  "We need to be on that plane!"  He yelled and pointed his big
  muscular arm at the attendant.

  "Sir, we closed the gate ten minutes ago.  The walkway has already
  been retracted.  That's not possible."

  "Well get us on another flight!" he hollared.  His laser-guided
  trimmed goatee seemed to bristle.  The attendant yammered at a
  keyboard.  I knew what the answer would be before she said it.

  "There are no more seats on that flight, sir."  The man clenched his
  fists.  His female companion, clad in glossy exercise clothes rolled
  up behind her.  She read his frustration and joined in the
  beratement.

  "I don't see how it's our fault that Obama delayed our flight!
  That's not fair."

  "Thanks, Obama" I whispered again.  They did not acknowledge my
  joke.  I pulled out my phone and stared at my lock-screen.

  "Look!  We're doctors!  We NEED to be in San Francisco tomorrow
  because we have patients to treat!  Are you guys going to treat our
  patients instead?"

  My thoughts drifted.  I imagined walking into a doctor's office
  being greeted by an American Airline's employee.  "Good morning.
  Your doctor's flight was delayed, so the airline sent me to check
  your prostate."

  "Honey," yelled baldy.  "They don't give a RAT'S ASS about us."  The
  two stormed away.  I sauntered up to the counter after them.

  "Hi... I think I have the same problem as that angry guy."  The
  attendant smirked as I continued, handing her my ticket.  "I was
  supposed to be on that connecting flight."  She proceeded to work on
  the computer.

  Wanting to capitalize on our rapport, I added "...and I'm not a
  doctor, so feel free to take your time."  The woman started
  laughing.

  "Don't worry about it - you were put on the next flight out.  Your
  plane leaves in two hours."  My mouth dropped in amazement.  "And
  feel free to tell that angry guy that you got the last seat."

  Which brings me here - Dear Reader.  Hunched over a wobbly table for
  one, charging my phone at a sticky power outlet that I may or may not
  have stabbed somebody for.  And I can't help but feel lucky.  Now if
  you'll excuse me, I need to get to gate =H-EE-V-31.2 article
  4b. (iii)=.  Hopefully sometime tonight I'll be somewhere in San
  Francisco - unless Obama manages to screw that up too.  Thanks,
  Obama.

* Sunday 9:46 PM CST - 30,000 ft. above the United States

  I get the impression that people who fly are supposed to appear
  disinterested.  I'm doing my best to fit in, but it's all just so
  exciting.  I'm attentive to everything mumbled over the airport
  loudspeaker.  I smirk as the plane lurches forward like a spaceship
  on the runway.  My face is practically pressed on the glass when the
  plane banks, revealing a wildly new perspective of the familiar
  Chicago skyline.

  I finally get to ride in a plane big enough for me to stand in - not
  that I'll be doing much standing.  The plane is 100% booked.  I kept
  an eye out for the angry doctor duo from earlier.  Part of me feels
  guilty for taking what could have been their seat.  Part of me
  wonders if I have any blood on my hands.  Let's hope for the sake of
  my conscience that they were just plastic surgeons and they were
  late for a tattoo removal or something.

  Everything on an airplane seems a lot tinier than I remember.  I
  feel like I've been making T-rex arms for the past three hours.  I
  could get a little more room if I tipped my seat back, but we've
  been in the air for at least an hour and I feel like that would be
  totally unfair to the guy behind me.  Everybody knows that if you
  don't change your seat within the first five seconds of sitting
  down, you really can't change it at all.  It's a binding social
  contract.  The guy behind probably has his heart set on keeping the
  extra 1.5 inches of leg room.

  Correction.  He has a neck-pillow.  Everybody knows that if you use
  a neck pillow in public, most social contracts don't apply to you.
  Sorry buddy.

  I'm going to pretend to sleep now.  On the outside, I'll be a cool,
  disinterested air traveler.  On the inside, I'm just a little kid
  pretending he's on a spaceship barreling towards Mars.

* Monday 7:51 AM PDT, Equator Coffee Shop, Market St.

  Well against all odds, I made it. Sorry I don't have any pictures of
  my digs yet.  I rolled into the hotel at what was biologically 2AM,
  threw my stuff on the ground, and just sort of collapsed.  Five
  hours later, I my phone stirred me from my coma and I realized I
  didn't have any toothpaste.  I also realized I don't know where
  anything is.

  I mimed several fake phonecalls while I did my best to look like I
  was intentionally walking in zig zags.  I already have a good
  navigation tip for you all: Market Street is the really big road
  with all the signs that say "Market Street".  Sometimes you have to
  put down Google Maps and just use what little self awareness you
  have at your disposal.

  I have about an hour until work starts.  I'm going to use it to
  catch up on emails and sponge my dried out brain with this delicious
  hipster fair-trade organic coffee.
