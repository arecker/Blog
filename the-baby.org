#+DESCRIPTION: We had a baby last week.  Here is the recap.
#+DATE: <2016-07-18 Mon>
#+STARTUP: showall

My wife and I found out we were expecting last fall.  It was a
complete surprise to us.  If it were really up to us, we would have
waited a few years.  But it didn't take us long to get caught up in
the excitement of our coming baby boy.  Maybe I would even get
motivated to finally move that 40ft Ethernet cable out of our hallway.

* Labor

Nine months later, we were killing time between contractions at home
before finally rolling into the hospital at 1 AM.I had never watched
a birth before.I should have probably prepared by watching one on
YouTube.I'll save you the grizzly details obviously, but here are
some observations that surprised me.

** Epidurals are the Real Miracle

Leading up to the epidural, everything felt like it was right out of a
medical drama.  My wife and I were stuck in triage for a few hours
while she was considerably dilated.  She handled it like a champ,
and left some pretty good nail marks in my arm.

But starting with the way the anesthesiologist
casually slid a metal cable into my wife's spine, things got
weirdly informal.

The labor pains were no more, and nurses and doctors began to
calmly float in and out of our room.  My wife was napping, surfing
the web, and even joking during contractions that looked
devastating judging by the graphs and instruments.

Part of me expected the birth to happen in the middle of the
night - maybe I would be wearing scrubs and sitting in a dimly lit
observation deck.  It hadn't dawned on me that it could instead
happen on a sunny Friday in the middle of the afternoon in about
fifteen minutes.

** Everything Else Feels Kind of Medieval

After being so floored by the precision and technology of an
epidural, the assisted labor by contrast looked purely medieval.

One of the nurses told us our child would need a vacuum delivery[fn:1].
This "vacuum" was literally just a suction cup connected to a hand
pump.  One nurse would plant it on the baby's head like a plunger
while the other nurse squeezed a hand pump.  At a few points, the
plunger would lose suction and make a hilarious /flubpf/ sound.

Meanwhile, plunger nurse is twisting the baby's head way harder
than I thought was possible - like the way James Bond would wrench
a goon's head around during a covert op.

But they tell me that babies are a lot tougher than they look.
Those weird soft spots in their head and pliable shoulders are
designed to facilitate being hiked out of the female body like a
Nerf football.

The procedure leaves the baby's head shaped like a cone.  I'm happy
to report after only 10 days, he no longer looks like one of the
aliens from /XCOM/.

** Nurses Know Everything

If you're like me, you've wondered when an actual adult sits you
down and explains how to do everything you'll need to do to take
care of the new human in your life.  The answer is a lot simpler
than it sounds - it's basically every nurse that walks into the
hospital room.

Five minutes with any given nurse was easily worth more than the
couple of hours of natal care videos we watched.  Nurses are a
godsend.

** Hello World!

The staff was happy to let us play our own music.  Like good
Wisconsinites, we played /Bon Iver/.  My son was born to the song
/Holocene/.  It was by chance, but given the music video[fn:2] follows a
young boy who wakes up in a rural cabin and wanders around a
breath-taking wilderness scene, I don't think we could have made a
better choice.

Rodney was born at 2:12 PM on July 8th, 2016.  He weighed 7 lbs, 2
oz.  He opened his enormous blue eyes immediately.  He was
perfect.  My eyes immediately welled up with gratitude.

* Going Home

We spent not even three full days in the hospital.Time behaves
weirdly there.It had felt like we had been living there for
months.

I was a little irked at how unofficial his naming felt.For some
reason, I was picturing a giant server room where we entered
~RODNEY~ into a console attached to a Deep Thought[fn:3] style super
computer.In reality, it was just a sheet of paper that I filled
out on my lap.

#+CAPTION: We look like we know what we're doing, right?

But nothing felt weirder than putting him in the car for the first
time.At that moment, it was clear to me that the fairy tail of
sitting in a clean white room with no sense of time and nothing to
do but stare into your baby's face was over.Now I had to mow the
lawn.I had to fill up the fridge.I still had to move that
Ethernet cable out of the hallway.

But friends, neighbors, and family to the rescue!Our fridge was
stocked with more food than we've ever had in the house.I love the
people in my life.Getting less than five hours of sleep isn't so
bad when you can slink downstairs in the middle of the night and eat
a spoonful of chicken pot pie, a handful of chips, and a grilled
chicken sandwich on the way back up the stairs.

* Advice

You get a lot of advice when you are getting ready to have the baby,
and it's almost always spontaneous.I'm not complaining.I'm
touched that so many people in my life were so eager to leave me
with their own nugget of wisdom, but inevitably people started to
repeat each other.

One such nugget Marissa and I heard a lot was "/Your life is about
to change./"I'd try to politely nod and thank them for the sage
advice, but sometimes I couldn't help myself from messing with
them.I'd patronize them in return by asking things like, "You
mean I won't be able to throw house parties on the weekends?What
about the 3 AM cock fights I like to host in my backyard on
Wednesdays?How is my life going to change there?"

#+END_QUOTE

Is my life about to change?That's true on any given day.Even
when we can point to a nostalgic time in which our lives felt
stable, I think it's only because we're not remembering all the
things that we worried about day to day.Rose tinted glasses will
do that to you.

Rodney was not born in a vacuum.He wasn't born in a castle in the
middle of a fairy tail.He'll grow up in a house next to a busy
road and a Burger King.The floor creeks, the kitchen still has
some sharp corners, and there is still a 40 ft Ethernet cable
tangled on the floor in the middle of our upstairs hallway.My life
probably will never feel the same.If it were a river, stepping
into it would probably feel a little different every day.But his
Mother can do anything, his dad is obsessed with him, and his furry
older brother would probably already jump off a bridge for him.

We hadn't planned on being parents, but we had no idea what we were
missing.I feel like I've spent a few hours a day just staring at
his face.My wife and I are constantly nudging each other every time
he stretches, yawns, or even has an impressive fart.

Hey everybody - this is my son.He changed my life.I'm a freakin'
dad.
