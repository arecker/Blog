#+TITLE: Wedding

Greetings friends!

After a few weeks of sifting, critiquing, formatting, copying,
uploading, and archiving, we /finally/ have the photos from our
wedding.  I’ll tell you - for a day that seemed to have went by in a
flash, I couldn’t be more grateful for the fantastic work of Amy and
Brook to help fill in all the gaps.

Marissa and I are so thankful for everyone that showed up.  Thanks for
making our day special.  Help yourself to any of the shots you feel
capture how fly you and your loved ones really are.  If you would like
any prints, pick out the ones you like (they are numbered) and shoot
marissa an [[mailto:marissa@reckerfamily.com][email]].

Peace!

Mr. and Mrs. Recker
