#+SUBTITLE: Wordpress has served me well, but my soul longs for the wilderness. Retreat with me into the backwoods of the Internet.

* My New Corner of the Internet

I'm sure you have noticed by now that things are a little
different. The awkward layout alone should be enought to tip you off
to the fact that I've jumped ship to something a little more home
brewed.

I present to you my pet project. It's a ghetto little markdown driven
CMS I've hacked together - and it's the most organic thing to leave my
kitchen since that spinache calzone (aside - brown spinach is bad
spinach. There - I've spared you the night long retching I endured to
learn the same lesson just last weekend).

The new diggs are part of an effor to be more minimal. I'm kind of
trying to do the transcendentalism thing, retreating to the Internet
equivalent of a cabin in the woods with no electricity.

* Goodbye, Wordpress

I have been using Wordpress from the beginning, and my experience with
it has been awesome. Computer people love Wordpress because it is
basically a one-click setup. You really just dump a bunch of code into
a folder, enter your database password, and you are good to go.

This is why Wordpress, in my book, still reigns supreme as the number
one roll-a-new-website-for-your-uncle-over-the-weekend content
management system.

But I was growing dissatisfied. Wordpress is written entirely in PHP,
so whenever a plugin broke, I basically just had to sit around and
wait for it to get fixed. I don't know PHP, and I certainly don't want
to learn it by fixing Wordpress plugins.

Secondly, since it was written for non-programming folk, all the
editing and site management is built right into the website. It's
convenient, but this puts a lot of pressure on your authentication for
the site. I was getting at least eight notifications on my phone daily
alerting me that someone else was trying to crack my password. I don't
think anyone succeeded, because I don't remember a time where my blog
looked like the Amazon of male enhancement pills.

Lastly, the database was really bumming me out. It's really easy to
set up, but a database is still a database. They have to be rebooted,
backed up, optimized, and occasionally they puke on your couch when
they eat something bad out of the garbage (whatever the linux server
equivalent of that is).

* For the Nerds

Warning: incoming nerd talk.

Throughout all these shortcomings, the Markdown bandwagon started to
look more and more appealing.

What is markdown? It's the new craze, and it's hard to find a web
developer these days who is not gushing over it.

Markdown is basically a text file that gets converted into a web
page. Through basic syntax rules, you can quickly create nice little
formatting touches that would take a litle more time to do by hand
(taking you out of the creative process of blogging - apparently).

For example, a markdown file would look something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Everybody Poops

## Welcome to my Weird Poop Blog

- Blogging
- NASDAQ
- Escrow

> Toy Story 2 was ok
#+END_EXAMPLE

Pretty simple to write. Here is where the magic lies. By the time it
makes it to the web browser, it looks like this:

-----
#+BEGIN_HTML
  <h1> Everybody Poops </h1> <h3> Welcome to my weird poop blog.
    </h3> <p> Hi there!  My name is Poop Smith.  Here are my hobbies:
    </p> <ul> <li> Blogging </li> <li> NASDAQ </li> <li> Escrow </li>
    </ul> <blockquote> <p> Toy Story 2 was ok.  </p>
#+END_HTML
-----

So all of my posts are written in markdown now. I don't have to back
them up because they are just pushed to GitHub like a regular source
file. If you are weird enough, I guess, you could deploy your very own
version of my Blog on your own website and it would stay up to date.

The posts are written in Markdown, but the engine is built on a
framework called Django.

My one beef with Django is that it is kind of bloaty. It's meant for
really big data entry websites. My site is a hacked down version of
Django. I basically created a project, then moved everything to a
single file appropriately named ~everything.py~. I starved the project
until it scratched my minimalist itch.

* Changelog

Ok ok ok - nerd talk over. Here is what has changed about the site:

** New Domain

My blog is now located at alexrecker.com . But you knew that
already. You are reading this after all. I will be setting up a site
redirect from the old blog and porting over all the posts that weren't
total garbage over to this one. So you don't have to worry your pretty
little head about fixing your bookmarks.

** Facebook Comments Only

I appreciate the comments - especially when they get zesty. I just
don't want to have to store them anymore. Additionally, the old blog
supported comments from Google+ too. I accompany my decision to drop
support for Google+ with a sincere apology to the only person who has
ever used Google+ to comment on my Blog. /Drew - I hope we can still
be friends/.

** RSS is not working (yet)

SS is not supported right now because of a small hang-up - and that
is... I'm not smart enough right now to write a RSS generator. I'm
going to throw a few more monkeys and typewriters at it and see what
kind of progress I can make. Again, I offer my sincere apologies to my
one RSS subscriber. /Drew - it's not you... it's me/.

* Brave New World

That being said, welcome to my new site. There's a lot of stuff still
broken, but I'm going to do what I can. We can take this journey
together - blogger and reader marching lock-step, hand-in-hand, making
our way through this brave new world of embarassing markdown parsing
glitches and catastrophic runtime errors.

And please be noisy! Beat the hell out of this thing. You can't battle
test a website without thowing some grenades. Go ahead and load it up
on your tablet, iPhone, Wii, and tamagotchi (if you still have one
laying around).

Thanks for reading my test post. You can go back to living your life
now.
