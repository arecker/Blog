#+TITLE: Uhh Yeah Dude

[[file:images/uyd.jpg]]

"What are your top five podcasts?"  This question is all over the
Internet these days.  I guarantee that if you put that on your
Facebook right now, you will come away with about eighty new podcasts
to try.  Which is why you have to trust me when I say this: /Uhh Yeah
Dude/ is something special.

When /Uhh Yeah Dude/ joined my podcast queue about two years ago, it
immediately felt different.  That's because it doesn't rush to hold
your attention.  There's no jingle, advertisements, or really any
immediate indication that you are listening to a podcast.  Each
episode opens with a song plucked from a lovingly curated playlist,
played in its entirety.  The music fades, the episode number is cited,
and off it goes for about sixty minutes before another song plays it
out.

But who are they, and what are they doing?  /Uhh Yeah Dude/ is simply
a conversation between Hollywood locals Jonathan Larroquette and Seth
Romatelli.  They weave between satire, commentary, story telling, and
cathartic venting all as part of a mediation best summed up by their
tagline, "America through the eyes of two /American/ Americans."
There are absolutely no inside jokes or context that needs to be
revisited, because somehow despite doing this show since February of
2006, Seth and Jonathan live in the present.  /Uhh Yeah Dude/ is a
conversation about the here and now.

"Comedy Podcast" falls so short in describing what they do.  Their
show is a performance art.  You haven't lived until you've heard Seth
incredulously dissect the Buffalo Wild Wings mission statement or
Jonathan recount the time he rescued a wild, exotic parrot from two
predatory birds on the side of the road.  Their wild anecdotes and
satisfying mockery mixed with their quirky tendency to change topics
without warning will leave you wondering where the last hour of your
life went.  Laughter is inevitable, but the second you confine the
show to "comedy podcast", it will surprise you with something
genuinely poignant, touching, and honest.  While no newspaper
headline, Craigslist personal, or Internet ad is safe from their
wandering banter, their originality and authenticity remains the
constant force that ties the show together.  Seth and Jonathan's deep
understanding of each other is palpable, and even contagious to the
point where you feel like you are in that East Hollywood apartment
snicking on the couch with them.

And that familiarity is no accident - it's crafted through numerous
live shows and other forms of active engagement with their listeners.
They even have a toll free voicemail that they encourage listeners to
call at any time of the day.  They repeat the phone number so often,
it feels like a catch phrase.  My wife called this number about a week
before my birthday with a pretty open ended request to give me some
kind of shoutout.  You can imagine my excitement when I found that
Seth had left me a two minute long voicemail where he leisurely read
the horoscopes from his local newspaper.

I don't know what else I can say about /Uhh Yeah Dude/, but somehow
leaving it in a brief "top five podcasts" list doesn't cut it.  This
podcast is like no other.  It's original, hilarious, thought
provoking, and a regular source of amusement and rejuvenation that I
have come to cherish.  It's time you fasten your seatbelt and give
/Uhh Yeah Dude/ a try.
